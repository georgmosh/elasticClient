Track And Know	Big Data for Mobility Tracking  Knowledge Extraction in Urban Areas	Track&Know will research, develop and exploit a new software framework that aims at increasing the efficiency of Big Data applications in the transport, mobility, motor insurance and health sectors. Stemming from industrial cases, Track&Know will develop user friendly toolboxes that will be readily applicable in the addressed markets, and will be also investigated in additional domains through liaison activities with running ICT-15 Lighthouse projects. Track&Know integrates multidisciplinary research teams from Mobility Data management, Complex Event Recognition, Geospatial Modelling, Complex Network Analysis, Transportation Engineering and Visual Analytics to develop new models and applications. Track&Know recognizes that Big Data penetration is not adequately developed in niche markets outside the traditional verticals (e.g. Finance) and so the Track&Know Toolboxes will be demonstrated in three real-world Pilots using datasets from niche market scenarios to validate efficiency improvements. Performance and impact benchmarks are elaborated and will be documented during pilots deployment. The Track&Know consortium is composed by complementary partners, coming from addressed research, technological and commercial domains, that have a proven track record of high quality research capacity. Thus, the carefully structured workplan, embodies a holistic approach towards meeting the Track&Know objectives and delivering market-relevant outcomes of significant exploitation potential
