  <objective>Scandecon´s innovation project aims at bringing the next generation technology and methodology for environmental dredging to the market. The core of Scandecon´s solution is a unique freeze technology that uses 75 % less power, shortens the time for freezing by 50 % and lowers costs by 30 % compared to other dredging methods. This is combined with a set of services that covers the entire value-chain for dredging, handling and disposal of contaminated sediment - making it a unique offer that sets a new standard for environmental dredging. Scandecon´s solution will initiate a paradigm shift in environmental dredging by allowing for new possibilities for cost-, time- and resource efficient removal of contaminated sediment at levels that can endanger marine life and human life. Applying Scandecon´s technology on polluted environments in soil, rivers, lakes and oceans will help states, municipalities and businesses to save hundreds of millions of Euro on dredging and handling of contaminated sediment.</objective>
