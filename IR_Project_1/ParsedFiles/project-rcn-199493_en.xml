  <objective>The arrival of immersive head-mounted displays to the consumer market will create a demand for immersive content of over 2 Billion euros in 2016. However, current audiovisual content is ill-suited for Immersive displays. For example, cuts between shots, which constitute the very basic fabric of traditional cinematic language, do not work well in immersive displays. ImmersiaTV will create a novel form of broadcast omnidirectional video content production and delivery that offers end-users a coherent audiovisual experience across head mounted displays, second screens and the traditional TV set, instead of having their attention divided across them. This novel kind of content will seamlessly integrate with and further augment traditional TV and second display consumer habits.  ImmersiaTV will assemble an end-to-end toolset covering the entire audiovisual value chain: immersive production tools, support for omnidirectional cameras, including ultra-high definition and high dynamic range images, and adaptive content coding and delivery, and demonstrate it through 3 pilot demonstrations addressing both on-demand and live content delivery.</objective>
