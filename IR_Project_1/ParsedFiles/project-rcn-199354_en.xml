  <objective>INSCAPE (In situ manufactured carbon-thermoplast curved stiffened panel) main objective is to enhance the automated thermoplastic fiber placement process and machine to manufacture an in situ consolidated double-curved structure including in situ joining of stiffener and skin laminate.

Taking the state-of-the-art into consideration, the proposed project will focus on using and enhancing the possibilities and advantages of automated thermoplastic Automated Fiber Placement (TP AFP) to create an efficient process to manufacture complex carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic aerospace structures.  The sensitivity of the process leads to a mandatory 100% automation for reproducible, industrial production.</objective>
