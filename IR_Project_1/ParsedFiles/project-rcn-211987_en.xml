  <objective>"""Portable power (~1-20 W) for small electronic devices is a high value added market. Batteries are the most convenient power devices but have relatively low energy capacity per unit mass and also slow recharge times. Micro-solid oxide fuel (micro-SOFC) cells are much better on both counts but currently operate at too high of a temperature (&gt;500°C). This project will reduce that temperature by 200°C in prototype test devices. It will do this by exploiting much improved materials in the micro-SOFC, these materials having been discovered and developed in an ERC AdG grant held by the PI. The project will involve prototype device fabrication and testing in conjunction with a small start-up company, the ultimate aim being to take the technology forward to market.""
