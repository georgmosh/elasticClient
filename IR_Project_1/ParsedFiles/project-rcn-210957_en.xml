  <objective>The main objective is to boost the company’s innovation capacity by conducting research on new optical fibre distributed sensors. This requires development of the specialised skillset within the company on optical fibre phenomena such as Rayleigh, Raman, Brillouin, and Coherent Rayleigh scattering. Hence the main goal is to overcome barriers of recruitment of highly specialised researcher and to recruit the specialist, who will be an initiator of the innovation potential growth in InPhoTech

The idea of the optical fibre distributed sensors follows a global trend in the global market for sensors and is a direct answer to the number of inquiries addressed to InPhoTech. The optical fibre distributed sensors allow to monitor critical infrastructure and manufacturing processes. Within the project we answer the European and global demand for reliable optical fibre sensing system, driven by need of connecting more and more sensors into IoT (Internet of Things), integration and miniaturisation of sensors, as well as the demand for accurate and early diagnosis devices in an effort to increase safety in industry.</objective>
