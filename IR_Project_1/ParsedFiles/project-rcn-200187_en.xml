  <objective>MAGIC Post Stroke Project Team has united members from across Europe, dedicated to enable significant change in the delivery of health &amp; social care (H&amp;SC) services for patients post stroke. The consortium has recognised a significant gap in care associated with the recovery of such patients &amp; we need a new way of meeting the needs of 508,000 new post stroke EU citizens/ year. Demographic changes are such that H&amp;SC systems are failing to keep pace with demand &amp; are not fit for purpose. By working in new ways &amp; by reengineering systems with novel innovative technology &amp; solutions we can think differently about our approach to care &amp; improve the well-being for our patients; optimising the opportunity for recovery post stroke. Presently 1/3rd of all stroke patients are discharged from hospital with a significant change to life style, well-being, health status &amp; independence. Community H&amp;SC services do not enable patients to make a sufficient recovery post stroke. A search of state of the art technologies indicated much progress in the development of technologies to assist patients but no system is available to significantly affect rehabilitative improvement to scale; with no solution integration with H&amp;SC services. Therefore, Public Procurers cannot go to open tender to deploy effective technology to solve system failures. The MAGIC Consortium recognised Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) as the only way to stimulate the market to find a solution to our common problem. MAGIC is an essential &amp; strategically critical programme for the Team to optimise a patientâ€™s recovery, to modernise H&amp;SC systems to meet demand &amp; to stimulate research, development &amp; innovation. MAGIC will also stimulate European industry to become a global leader in this innovative field. Use of PCP is of particular interest to the consortium members &amp; is new for many. Therefore, observer states will participate to contribute to the Pan-European improvement in care and to proactively share PCP knowledge.</objective>
