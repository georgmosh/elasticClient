  <objective>The Directional Composites through Manufacturing Innovation (DiCoMI) project aims to bring together leading innovatorsfrom across Europe, and beyond, to develop a new method of producing composite material parts with optimised fibredirectionality. The DiCoMI project will integrate advanced manufacturing techniques, composite materials science, and
manufacturing system design. As such, it requires a high level of inter-disciplinary cooperation as well as collaborationbetween researchers and industrials. The outcome will be a truly novel composites manufacturing system capable of producing parts with increased accuracy, reduced cost and enhanced functionality.

DiCoMI project will focus on Directional Fibre-Reinforced Polymers (FRP) materials and combined different manufacturing techniques into a unique and innovative hybrid system. DiCoMI project will have a direct impact on the European and international scientific state of the art in the fields of composite materials and manufacturing equipment, while supporting the innovation potential in the automotive and aerospace industries.</objective>
