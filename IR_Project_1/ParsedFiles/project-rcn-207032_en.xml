  <objective>Digital technologies underpin innovation and competitiveness across a broad range of market sectors. A key technology to boost such innovation and competitiveness is represented by the full and wide adoption of Open Service Platforms. In fact, they will allow increased competition and market penetration because they should be built on top of royalty-free open specifications, adopting open source reference implementations, and s such allowed to be offered by multiple vendors. The Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technology Development (FP7) has developed the FIWARE platform which has demonstrated its potential of becoming a service platform of choice, with proven potential for usage by SMEs and startups. This rises to the extent that four main ICT players in Europe with global ambition have put FIWARE in their strategy for market development. More than that, those four players announced the creation of an open to all legal entity, the FIWARE Foundation, to have more stakeholders driving the evolution of FIWARE. Well in this scope, the aim of the FI-NEXT project is to put in place all the measures necessary in order to make FIWARE materializing such a potential. This will achieved pursuing the following objectives: a) bringing FIWARE from an European Open Source project to a global Open Source Community, b) ensuring FIWARE meets the highest quality standards and best technical support, c) positioning FIWARE as the de facto standard for the development of smart applications, and d) ensuring FIWARE Lab to be a self-sustainable environment.</objective>
