  <objective>The aim of the project is to design a system to support the knowledge base of SIRIS Academic S.L., a consultancy company specialized in higher education and research. 
With a PhD in Knowledge Representation and reasoning, and a knowledge of related state-of-the art tools, the Associate will be invited to apply the so-called Semantic Web and Ontology-based Data Access (OBDA) technologies for the integration of the HE&amp;R knowledge corpus currently used by our consultants.
This knowledge base should facilitate the organisation of the consultants' qualitative knowledge of the sector. It will be a tool to train future consultants, and - in connection with the open data query portal already developed by SIRIS - an instrument to enhance the quality of the consultancy. The Innovation Associate will work on the direct supervision of a senior consultant of the company, as well as a research specialised in KR and ontology. He/she is expected to a) get an in-depth knowledge of the current state of SIRIS's knowledge and tool to generate ideas of KM tools; b) implement a first prototype and get users' feedback; c) set up a plan to scale up the prototype at the level of the company.</objective>
