  <objective>The standard solution of a landing gear integrated into the wings, that is widely used in the actual single aisle aircraft configuration, even if extensively safe in terms of structural load distribution, leads to many  drawbacks both referred to the structural configuration and weight and also related to the structural integration of the different components during the aircraft final assembly and set-up.  
New solutions need to be supported by a big efforts in terms of design and materials optimization and manufacturing processes. 
The scope of ITEMB project is to set up an innovative Lower Center Fuselage (LCF) architecture compliant with Body Landing Gear scenario, including high loaded structure, highly integrated concept and industrial processes validation.</objective>
