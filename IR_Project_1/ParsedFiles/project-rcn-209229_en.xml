  <acronym>FISHODOR</acronym>
  <objective>The aim of FISHODOR is to establish the identity of neural network components of the recently discovered tilapia reproductive pheromone. It will identify pheromone olfactory receptor(s) and their intracellular transduction pathways thereby increasing our understanding of olfactory perception and signal integration of fish pheromones. The project will determine the neuronal cell type (i.e. ciliated, microvillous or crypt-type olfactory receptor neurons) detecting the pheromone, it will establish the transduction pathways (i.e. AC/cAMP or PLC/IP3) involved in its olfactory detection and will identify the olfactory receptor(s) that binds the pheromone. If enough time is available it will attempt to map the neuronal network involved in the neuroendocrine response. The combination of electrophysiology, transcriptomics and molecular biology will bring high degree of novelty to explain the mechanism of action of olfactory receptor and neuronal signal integration.</objective>
