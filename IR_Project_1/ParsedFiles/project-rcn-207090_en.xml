  <acronym>ELEONE</acronym>
  <objective>Eleone solution has been conceived to increase quality and productivity within the automotive and aerospace sectors by reducing costs and facilitating the dimensional and quality controls procedures of pieces in the assembly chains. It provides a solution based on an autonomous mechatronic sensor (based on a patented alternating magnetic band mechanic system) that attaches to a mechanical standard support to fit each measured part, facilitating users to easily install several sensors, that can measure simultaneously many points in all environments, As a consequence this Eleone solution can be integrated into production lines allowing quality control to reach all manufactured parts In addition Eleone provides RFID reader or barcode and measurement acquisition software avoiding manual procedures and allowing automated inspection and informing the operator on the quality of production in real time.</objective>
