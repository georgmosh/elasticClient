  <acronym>ReUseHeat</acronym>
  <objective>There is enough waste energy produced in the EU to heat the EUâ€™s entire building stock; however despite of this huge potential, only a restricted number of small scale examples of urban waste heat recovery are present across the EU. The objective of REUSEHEAT is to demonstrate, at TRL8 first of their kind advanced, modular and replicable systems enabling the recovery and reuse of waste heat available at the urban level. 

REUSEHEAT explicitly builds on previous knowledge and EU funded projects (notably CELSIUS, Stratego and HRE4) and intends to overcome both technical and non technical barriers towards the unlocking of urban waste heat recovery investments across Europe. 

Four large scale demonstrators will be deployed, monitored and evaluated during the project, showing the technical feasibility and economic viability of waste heat recovery and reuse from data centres (Brunswick), sewage collectors (Nice), cooling system of a hospital (Madrid) and underground station (Bucharest). The knowledge generated from the demonstrators and from other examples across the EU will be consolidated into a handbook which will provide future investors with new insight in terms of urban waste heat recovery potential across the EU. Innovative and efficient technologies and solutions, suitable business models and contractual arrangements, estimation of investment risk, bankability and impact of urban waste heat recovery investments, authorization procedures are examples of handbook content. The handbook will be promoted through a powerful dissemination and training strategy in order to encourage a rapid and widespread replication of the demonstrated solutions across the EU.</objective>
