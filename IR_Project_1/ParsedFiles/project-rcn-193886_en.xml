  <objective>INTRAW will map and develop new cooperation opportunities related to raw materials in Australia, Canada, Japan, South Africa and the United States, addressing:

• Research and innovation;
• Raw materials policies and strategies
• Joint educational and skills programmes;
• Licensing and permitting procedures;
• Data reporting systems;
• Exploration, extraction, processing and recycling practices;
• Management and substitution of Critical Raw Materials.

The outcome of the mapping and knowledge transfer activities will be used as a baseline to set and launch the European Union’s International Observatory for Raw Materials as a definitive raw materials intelligence infrastructure, operating internationally. The Observatory will be a permanent body that will remain operational after the project completion, with a clear strategy and management approach, aiming for the establishment and maintenance of strong long-term relationships with the world’s key players in raw materials technology and scientific developments. The Observatory will not only continuously monitor cooperation possibilities but will also actively promote these via the establishment of dedicated bilateral and multilateral funding schemes and incentives for raw materials cooperation between the EU and technologically advanced countries outside the EU.</objective>
