  <acronym>YorNight</acronym>
  <objective>York is an incredibly exciting, vibrant and diverse city, rich in heritage, discovery and an overriding sense of curiosity – in short a city where ideas spring to life and flourish and where collaboration is celebrated. YorNight is symbolic of this collaborative energy with partners across the city involved in promoting a wide range of stimulating events.  
Our over-arching objective is to enhance the public recognition of researchers and their work.  YorNight will achieve its objective through the delivery of five key messages:


  M1.  Researchers are amongst us
  M2.  What’s up with research and innovation? 
  M3.  Research eases your life and increases your well-being 
  M4.  Research is fun
  M5.  Being researcher is exciting and amazing

These five messages will be central to our Awareness Campaign and our Activities on the Night. YorNight will specifically target young people and seek to influence their perception of researchers and promote scientific careers. The team has received special permission from the UK Scouting and Guiding movement to design a new two-part occasional badge to celebrate European Researchers’ Night. In 2014 and 2015 YorNight will pilot this badge with the aim of expanding the innovation across Europe as part of future Researchers’ Nights, where the Scouting and Guiding movements actively engage an estimated 2.4 million young people.
As the UK’s only Heritage and Science city, York is a relevant and unique Researchers’ Night host. The project’s Work Programme will celebrate and explain the depth and breadth of this research across the two years in the theme York: City of the Past, City of the Future. The Work Programme seeks to deliver its key messages through an integrated programme encouraging participants to “Discover and Explore” the research that is all around them, and to meet the researchers who helped bring it to life.</objective>
