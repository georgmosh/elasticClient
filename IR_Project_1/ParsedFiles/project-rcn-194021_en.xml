  <objective>The Danish EEN will provide skilled Innovation Management Capacity Building personnel to provide two services: 
Key Account Management Services to SMEs in the SME Instrument and Innovation Management Capacity Building services to potential high growth SMEs. A total of minimum 20 service packages will be implemented. 

Two tools will be used to carry out these tasks - Growthmapper for the KAM role, to provide a brief and simple feedback on the company's management ability and IMP3rove for all IMCB cases, to provide a thorough picture of the innovation management capacity of the SMEs. 

Companies in the IMBC work will be integrated with the wider Danish and European innovation support eco-system.</objective>
