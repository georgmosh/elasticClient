  <objective>Circular Agronomics (CA) provides a comprehensive synthesis of practical solutions to improve the current Carbon (C), Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) cycling in European agro-ecosystems and related up- and down-stream processes within the value-chain of food production. The proposed solutions would constitute a further step towards making agriculture an integral part of a circular economy by increasing resource efficiency while simultaneously addressing associated environmental challenges such as greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions as well as eutrophication of water bodies. Along 7 work packages and 6 case-studies, representing locations with different biogeographic conditions and environmental challenges typical for the European agricultural sector, the objective of CA is to contribute to a development towards sustainable, resilient and inclusive economies that are part of circular and zero-waste societies. The involved multi-actor and international consortium aims (i) To increase the understanding of C, N, P flows and the related potential to reduce environmental impacts at farm and regional level under different bio-geographical conditions; (ii) To close loops within cropland farming, from livestock to cropland farming and to increase the reuse of waste/wastewater from food-industry to improve soil fertility and to increase nutrient use efficiency; (iii) To highlight the performance of different prototypes of agro-ecological systems and increase sustainability of food production in the EU; and (iv) To contribute to the improvement of the European Agricultural Policies by providing evidence based, farmer led and consumer relevant recommendations for the agri-food chain. Cross-cutting social, economic and environmental evaluation ensure the overall sustainability of the investigated solution.</objective>
