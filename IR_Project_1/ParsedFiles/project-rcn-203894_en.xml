  <acronym>REPROHEAT</acronym>
  <objective>High ambient temperatures represent an obstacle for reproductive development in plants. Our own preliminary data indicate that mutations affecting auxin methylation facilitate pollen tube growth and confer increased reproductive capacity under higher temperatures in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We propose to explore the benefit of reducing auxin methylation in temperature-sensitive crops like tomato and rice to maintain higher fruit/grain yields under heat and drought stress conditions. The research program includes field testing of new tomato varieties generated in this project, in conjunction with a crop company. The combined approach using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology and chemical genetics, together with the thorough training program that we have devised, is targeted at complementing Dr. Resentiniâ€™s strong experience in plant molecular and cellular biology. By the end of the term, she will have an advantageous professional position at the interphase between Academy and European Industry.</objective>
