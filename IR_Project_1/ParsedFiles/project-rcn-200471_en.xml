  <objective>Aquablast Limited, www.aquablast.co.uk, are pioneers of Ultra High Pressure (UHP) waterjet technology with operating pressures up to 60,000 psi, which is now an industry standard for steel and concrete surface preparation and cutting.
We are now introducing UHP water techniques to the recycling industry through Recyclatrack- a process that recovers and recycles end-of-life rubber crawler tracks using UHP water-jets.

Recyclatrack has been developed so that construction equipment Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEMs), Maintenance, Repair &amp; Overhaul (MROs) and plant hire companies can dispose of growing numbers of decommissioned steel/rubber composite crawler tracks safely and cost-effectively with a sustainable and environmentally compliant process.

Recyclatrack is a patent-pending ‘green’ solution for this problematic waste stream , achieving 100% recycling of scrap crawler tracks to recover high grade ferrous scrap and rubber crumb, both of which are readily integrated back into the market.</objective>
