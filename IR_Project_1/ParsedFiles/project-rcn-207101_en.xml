  <objective>We are about to deploy into the market WILDTHING, a citizen collaboration-based multiplatform application for the control of Invasive Alien Flora Species. Provided flora species populations are dynamic entities, WILDTHING is designed for the creation and maintenance in real time of a global vision of the spatial distribution of Invasive Alien Flora Species. Following the Regulation 1143/2014 recommendations, WILDTHING allows citizen participation, since they are, along with civil servants, the actors in the field for the detection and reporting of new locations of Invasive Alien Species (IAS). Afterwards, the reported locations are validated by experts in order to avoid false detections. WILDTHING will integrate gamification techniques to engage and motivate citizens to use the platform. WIDTHING provides a great variety of management tools to environmental managers in order to monitor the invasive species populations and develop effective and efficient control plans.</objective>
