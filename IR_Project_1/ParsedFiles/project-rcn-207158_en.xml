  <objective>The main objective of the idea behind ReadyToSail is the development and commercialization of a wireless real-time positioning, global communication and monitoring platform, mainly focused on marine environments. It includes some additional features like autopiloting and emergency calls. ReadyToSail will rely on the Galileo constellation and its most relevant service:  Search and Rescue. The ReadyToSail platform will be a device based on a modular architecture offering new user-oriented services in constant evolution, such as remote monitoring and alert management. Moreover, the proposed solution will be designed to be easily integrated with current SAT-AIS modules.</objective>
