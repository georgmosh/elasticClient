  <objective>UVALITH proposes to advance optical frequency conversion technology developed for the FET Proactive project QUIC (Quantum Simulation of Insulators and Conductors) toward industrial and biomedical use. Optical frequency converters use nonlinear optical processes such as second harmonic generation to produce coherent light at wavelengths that are not available, or not efficient, with existing laser sources. Importantly, optical frequency converters can reach near-ultraviolet (UVA) wavelengths, employed in biological and medical applications based on fluorescent biomarkers. In QUIC, we have developed a monolithic frequency converter, in which a single nonlinear optical crystal acts simultaneously as an optical resonator, frequency converter, and tuning system. The resulting device is compact and extremely stable, and efficiently converts inexpensive near-infrared (NIR) light into coherent UVA. UVALITH will advance this recently-patented technology from the laboratory proof-of-principle stage to a technology level suitable for uptake by industrial and commercial actors, including advances in scalability, versatility and reliability.</objective>
