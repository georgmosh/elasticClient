INVENTORY is a business model innovation project with the objective to create the first online business-to-business marketplace for manufacturing SMEs, which connects industrial companies with new clients and suppliers across the EU. INVENTORY is targeted to 22 million SMEs in the EU who are seeking for opportunities to expand their client base and find new suppliers to optimize costs. As the outcome, the INVENTORY project increases visibility and competitiveness of SMEs on the EU market by creating conditions for an efficient market. 

INVENTORY provides product recognition systems, standardised and comparable product information, real-time automated inventory management, deposit service, extensive compatibility with other software and simple set-up. These are all essential characteristics of an efficient and effective marketplace that current European market lacks.

The objective of the feasibility study is to identify and assess technical and commercial feasibility of INVENTORY. We want to conduct more extensive research on market size, growth and trends for different segments, understand better relative strengths and weaknesses of INVENTORY, analyse market barriers and to identify technical obstacles.</objective>
