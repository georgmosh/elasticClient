  <objective>We will develop new dual catalytic reactions based on the complementary reactivity of gold (I) and other transition metals. We will perform well developed gold-catalysed isomerisation reactions and intercept carbenoid intermediates through a transmetallation event with a more redox active metal such as palladium (0). Following this the resulting palladium carbenoid will perform a variety of cross-coupling reactions including: dimerisations, C-X insertions and C-H insertions. This approach has not been reported previously and would provide new reactions and disconnections for the synthetic chemist. This project will be delivered by Dr Tapas Ghosh, a highly experienced and accomplished researcher currently working at Izmir Institute of Technology, Turkey.</objective>
