  <objective>The proposed work will exploit the expertise and know-how of the host institute and the fellow to develop a strategy for the detection and screening of genetic mutations in a highly parallelised fashion.The project has an overall objective to develop an electrochemical single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection strategy by using polyoxometalate (POM) labeled DNA (including PCR primers, dNTPs and ddNTPs) for use in solid-phase melting curve analysis and sold-phase array based primer extension and solid phase ligase mediated detection.  In order to achieve this, robust surface for anchoring of DNA probes capable of withstanding elevated temperature for enzymatic reactions either in solid phase melting curve analysis or single dideoxynucleotide incorporation will be developed. The proposed strategies will allow for highly cost-effective, rapid and user-friendly platforms for the screening of genetic mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms.</objective>
