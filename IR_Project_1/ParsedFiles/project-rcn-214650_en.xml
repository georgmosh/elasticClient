  <objective>This proposal suggests that taking a strategic approach – in the most fundamental sense - to the renewal of organization and management of European public administrations is a key requirement for the bettering of public governance and citizens’ participation across Europe. 

The project aims to locate, explore and diffuse leading edge experiments in new and more participatory approaches to public administration which are becoming evident across various countries in Europe. Ultimately, the project aims at generating applicable knowledge about the dynamics and developmental patterns of longitudinal, emergent strategy formation processes and the dynamics leading to strategic renewal and community engagement.

We draw on four promising models apparent in the recent public management literature to inform the empirical work theoretically, namely: Public Value Creation models, used in combination with Co Creation and Co Governance (hence the acronym COGOV) ideas, in turn combined with Digital Era Governance inspirations with their possible implications for more participatory approaches to e-government. The project relies on a pan European collaboration of academic and policy partners and is strongly connected to, and informed by, practice.</objective>
