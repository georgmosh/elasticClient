  <objective>Gold catalysis has become a powerful tool for organic chemists to streamline synthesis of valuable and complex molecules. Compared to other transition metals, gold complexes are remarkably stable towards air and water, and are essentially non-toxic, which make them ideal candidates to execute catalytic cross-coupling reactions in industry or in vivo. TWINGOLD aims at broadening the current applications of gold catalysis, exploring and identifying reliable dinuclear gold(I) catalysts in C-C forming reactions. The use of dinuclear gold catalysts could lower activation barriers of chemical transformations and thus allow access to reaction pathways that are difficult to accomplish with mononuclear gold systems. TWINGOLD will promote gold catalysis significantly by exploring novel cross-coupling reactions and the related mechanistic elements behind them, enabling use of more diverse raw materials and, thus, ensuring a more sustainable and inclusive economy in EU. In addition, the project will enable the Experienced Researcher to develop a full range of scientific and transferable skills following a personalized Career Development Plan to become an established researcher (R3).</objective>
