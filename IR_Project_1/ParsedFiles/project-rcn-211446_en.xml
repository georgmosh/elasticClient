  <objective>Envision a full envelope concept that harvests solar energy from the 120 billion square meters of building surface available within the EU28. Envision using the currently unused 60 billion square meters of façade surface. That is why ‘ENVISION’ will demonstrate a full renovation concept that, for the first time, harvests energy from ALL building surfaces (transparent and opaque). The hybrid harvesting solutions will harvest energy both thermal and electric from the whole envelope, using standard PV solutions for roof and developing new solutions for the façade. As façade solutions have the lowest TRL, ‘ENVISION’ will develop energy harvesting invisible aesthetic façade solutions. The solutions will harvest maximum amount of solar energy and simultaneously retain the aesthetic and functional properties of the façade. To maximise efficient usage of the harvested energy, the solutions are coupled to novel heat systems and district heat networks.

ENVISION’ focusses on energy harvesting of the façade, and works by absorbing the invisible part  of the solar radiation (the near-infrared (NIR) part, roughly 50% of the solar energy spectrum) allowing visible aspects to be retained. The ‘ENVISION’ harvesting of solar energy is achieved via: 
1. heat collecting non-transparent aesthetically pleasing façade elements by harvesting the NIR solar radiation,
2. heat harvesting ventilated glass by harvesting the NIR solar radiation,
3. electricity harvesting photovoltaic glazing solutions</objective>
