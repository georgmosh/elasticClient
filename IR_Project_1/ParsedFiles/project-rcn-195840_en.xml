  <objective>The extent to which nuclei can comprise lighter nuclear clusters in low-mass systems directly influences astrophysical production and decay rates. However, the scope of clustering away from stability has yet to be fully investigated. This proposal will address this by implementing novel measurement apparatus for exotic clustering in key short-lived isotopes using resonant elastic scattering and at the same time demonstrate an improved spectroscopic tool that can be applied to a wide range of nuclear structure studies. This is possible because of key charged-particle detector expertise of the ER and the Supervisor complementing both the ER's experience in radioactive ion beams and the MC40 cyclotron facility at Birmingham. Birmingham's world-class leadership in clustering and charged-particle spectroscopy make this location an ideal host. The result is a focused proposal that will lead to a flexible tool for extracting precise structure data from radioactive beam experiments, answering questions at the frontiers of nuclear stability, models and nuclear astrophysics. A significant reduction in beam-time required for such investigations will be achieved making the apparatus practical for use at international user facilities while opening more systems to this technique and reducing background.</objective>
