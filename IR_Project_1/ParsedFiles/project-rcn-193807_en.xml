  <acronym>Carbon Heaters</acronym>
  <objective>We have created a high performance, ultra-light and ultra strong carbon nanotube (CNT) film electrical heaters. Compared to traditional heating materials, they are super fast (reach the terminal temperature in less than (1/4s), lighter (100x), resistant to corrosion (concentrated acids do not affect them) and cheaper (a fraction of the cost). The heaters are fully scalable from nano-sized devices to full size applications on commercial aircrafts. Previous experiments involved a range of material sizes, from transformations on a molecular level to rapid de-icing of a model aircraft . The performance of the heaters revealed a
12,000,000% advantage by weight over the current most common heating alternative: resistive wires made of nickelchromium
alloy. In this proposal, we show how this invention could alleviate the problem of aircraft de-icing.</objective>
