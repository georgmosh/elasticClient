  <objective>About 20 million  hectares  of  arable  lands  are  irrigated with wastewaters  in  the world  and  almost nothing  is  known  about  the  presence,  evolution  and  dissemination  of  antibiotic  resistant  bacteria  and  antibiotic resistance  genes  in  these  fields,  and  their  possible  transmission  to  humans  and  animals  via  the  food  chain. The proposed  project will  address  that  scientific  question  by  using  analytical  chemistry,  flow  cytometry, molecular biology, metagenomic approaches, and computational biology, in order to characterise antibiotic resistant bacterial community  structures  and  antibiotic  resistance  genes  in  untreated  wastewaters  and  the  corresponding  irrigated agricultural sites compared to control sites in low and middle income countries, as well as the influence of abiotic factors.  The new scientific data arising from this project will help to determine the factors that drive resistance and can be minimized by developing strategies  to prevent  further spread of antibiotic  resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance  genes worldwide. The  fellow, with  a  strong  background  in Microbial  ecology  and Biochemistry, will conduct  this  project  under  the  supervision  of  Prof  Piddock,  a  medical  microbiologist  and  expert  in  antibiotic resistance, at the University of Birmingham.</objective>
