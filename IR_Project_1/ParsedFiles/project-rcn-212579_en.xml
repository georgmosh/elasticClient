  <objective>Recent advances in the measurement of flow in highly energetic tidal currents allows the effects of both turbulence and ocean waves to be characterised. This provides improved understanding of the causes of failure in tidal devices, including blades, seals, bearings, PTO &amp; other critical components. Combining this new understanding with state-of-the-art condition monitoring systems will allow fault-tolerant, resilient, components to be designed.

The project will combine innovation in flow measurement, condition monitoring and turbine
components with tide-to-wire modelling to design reliable power take off &amp; control systems delivering grid compliant energy. This is only possible by the inclusion of partners with:
(1.) a proven track record of high resolution flow measurements in the highly energetic waters of the EMEC tidal site,
(2.) access to open- sea pilot test site and turbine data,
(3.) world leading capabilities in testing of materials for the marine environment, in design, construction, installation and operation of tidal devices, condition monitoring / condition-
based maintenance, world leading tank test facilities, and a detailed understanding of technology verification &amp; certification in offshore energy.

Machines using the outputs of the project will be a key part of new bankable projects to deliver electricity at a highly competitive LCE.

Through the design of reliable intelligent blades and components with integrated condition monitoring, for the first time, provide [...know how...] for Real Turbines, operating in Real Seas and under Real Conditions.</objective>
