  <objective>The main objective of the project is the development of the pilot scale production system of the new generation of nanoporous organic and hybrid aerogels with multiple functions for application in gas and humidity adsorption, personal care and food. Thereby the fast manufacturing in form of spherical particles will be in focus in order to reduce the process time and to decrease the overall process costs. Thereby the purpose is to insure the high porosity and internal pore size distribution of the particles in order to provide the high surface area, pore volume and defined pore size needed for good adsorption capability. The production of organic aerogel particles in sufficient amounts will firstly enable the possibility to build prototypes for the applications in gas and humidity adsorption and food and to perform the corresponding tests. Based on the results of the test the properties of aerogels will be fine-tuned for the corresponding real applications in industrial environments. By this means it is intended to increase the technology readiness level of organic aerogels production from TLR 4 to TLR 6 by the end of the project.</objective>
