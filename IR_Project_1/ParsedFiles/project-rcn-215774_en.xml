  <acronym>NeuroRBP</acronym>
  <objective>RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) coordinate post-transcriptional regulation immediately after transcription by RNA-processing, nuclear export, localization, stability and translation rate of RNAs. The importance of these RBPs in neural development have been underscored by detecting their mutations in severe neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), ataxia or tremor. In this project, using the assays that I developed specifically for the identification of RBPs I want to track down novel RBPs involved in neural differentiation. I will use patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), as model system to discover RBPs that their malfunction may lead to neurodegeneration. Furthermore, I will identify the binding targets of the RBPs to determine the pathways that are affected. Finally, using machine-learning methods I will integrate these data to shed new light on the mechanism of neural differentiation and degeneration. The output of this project in long term will help to identify individuals at risk, and to develop better therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases.</objective>
