  <objective>Danish SME Unisense A/S has developed an industrial Micro Electrochemical Cell sensor (iMEC) for automatically quantifying dissolved gasses in liquids. In this project, Unisense will optimize their existing handmade sensors, customized for each client, to an auto-calibrated industrial version, targeting wastewater utility companies.
In the sewer systems, the prevalence of the toxic H2S gas (sewage gas) causes sewer corrosion and collapse, while at the same time entailing odour nuisances for the population living nearby. The robust iMEC sensor can be installed directly in the sewer network to accurately map H2S contents in real-time, and provide feedback to pumping stations to adjust the chemicals dosed accordingly. This will allow utilities to effectively control H2S levels in wastewater, thereby avoiding corrossion and toxic H2S leaks, and bringing significant economical savings to utilities and municipalities.</objective>
