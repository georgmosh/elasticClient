  <objective>KRTS The Art of Losing Weight TM is an interactive on-line psychological boot camp that is supported by audio and video. Using a unique, innovative approach, it takes people who are struggling with their eating and weight from feeling frustrated and helpless, to having a focused and empowered mind-set. It also enables them to follow an individual blueprint detailing the necessary action to achieve their weight loss goal. It can be accessed virtually from anywhere in the world using the Internet. A long term outcome of the programme will be to reduce the societal challenge of pressure on the NHS and other European Health Systems caused by obesity related problems. The problem to be solved is the rise in levels of obesity which has been seen in the UK and internationally.</objective>
