  <objective>Stroke a leading cause of death and disability, with an estimated total cost of €65 billion per year in Europe. Even though preventive measures are in place to reduce the incidence of stroke, the number of persons having a stroke in Europe is likely to increase from 1.1 million/year in 2000 to more than 1.5 million/year in 2025 because of the increasing ageing population. Secondary stroke carries with it a greater risk than first-ever stroke for death and disability. Also, as mortality from first strokes has decreased recently, the number of people at risk for a secondary stroke has increased, with an associated increase in healthcare costs. In order to reduce these stroke statistics and the associated cost, the self-management of stroke risk factors is particularly suitable and necessary for the following reasons: 1) risk factors for stroke are well-known, and 2) 90% of strokes or secondary stroke events are preventable if the risk factors are managed appropriately. The Decision SupporT and self-mAnagement system for stRoke survivoRs (STARR) project and the system developed in it are targeting the self-management of stroke risk factors. Based on existing computational predictive models of stroke risk, we will develop a modular, affordable, and easy-to-use system, which will inform stroke survivors about the relation between their daily activities (e.g., medication intake, physical and cognitive exercises, diet, social contacts) and the risk of having a secondary stroke. This will lead to better prevention and a reduction of the number of secondary stroke events, as well as to a more efficient participation of patients in medical decision-making. A multidisciplinary consortium has been built for achieving the objectives of this ambitious project, involving stroke survivors’ associations, healthcare actors, sensing and human-machine interfaces experts. The consortium also comprises 3 European companies which will exploit the results of the project after its end.</objective>
