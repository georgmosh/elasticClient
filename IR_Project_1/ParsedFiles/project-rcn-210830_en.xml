  <objective>The main goal of M4F project is to bring together the fusion and fission materials communities working on the prediction of microstructural-induced irradiation damage and deformation mechanisms of irradiated ferritic/martensitic (F/M) steels. M4F project is a multidisciplinary one, were both modeling and experiments at different scales will be integrated to foster the understanding of complex phenomena associated to the formation and evolution of irradiation induced defects and their role on the deformation behavior. In addition, an attempt to reduce the gap between the materials science activities as model and experiments, and the needed inputs on design codes will be included</objective>
