  <objective>The European Reference Network for Critical Infrastructure Protection (ERNCIP) has the mission to foster the emergence of
innovative, qualified, efficient and competitive security solutions, through the networking of European experimental
capabilities.

Since 2012, ERNCIP has developed and shared a good understanding of technologies responding to CBRN-E threats. ERNCIP groups have produced many reports that underpin that understanding and are now developing technical recommendations and good practice for infrastructure operators who wish to deploy technologies against such threats.

This proposal will enable ERNCIP to focus its efforts on preparing concrete recommendations, pre-norms or workshop agreements, in the thematic areas of RN threat detection and analysis; the detection of chemical or biological agents in drinking water; testing the resistance of building glazing materials to explosive effects; and detection of explosives and weapons at secure locations.

JRC is the facilitator of this network which comprises around 200 experts from 120 European organisations. It sets up the groups, facilitates their work and ensures that they address the issues most relevant to the policy makers. It also
ensures that the work of the groups receive world-wide visibility.</objective>
