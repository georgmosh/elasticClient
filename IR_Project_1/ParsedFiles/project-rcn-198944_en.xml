  <objective>Eco-efficient high-yield production of antioxidant compounds from microalgae
Through the development of a disruptive photobioreactor design and cultivation protocol, we plan to reach a production of high-quality microalgae with an improved content in valuable antioxidants, at a reduced production cost. This cost reduction will be obtained through a dramatic reduction of the energy required for the production, greatly improving the sustainability of microalgae production.
The microalgae products can enter the formulations of nutritional supplements or animal food.</objective>
