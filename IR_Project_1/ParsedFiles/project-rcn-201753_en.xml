  <objective>Due to the health risk for those suffering from Celiac Disease and other intolerances, Allogen Biotech Ltd.’s Rapid Allergen Detector (RAD) kits can detect a range of protein-based allergen in food or cosmetics, in a compact portable reader and disposable testing strips. The kits are versatile, with a cartridge-based reagent to identify and concentrate allergens for detection, and an accurate reader that can provide quantitative readouts for industrial users or a simple “traffic light” system for consumer model users. Results are available in 10 seconds or less, a reader can be used for over 10,000 tests, and test strips are simple to use, with a low cost.</objective>
