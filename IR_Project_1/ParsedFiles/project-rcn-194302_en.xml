  <objective>The objective of the I-ALLOW project is therefore to study, design, develop and test an innovative approach which improves the safety of population and infrastructure in day time, night time and all-weather conditions by proving a state of the art multi-spectral imaging and processing system.
I-ALLOW will be able to:
•             A low cost single sensor imaging solution with versatile capabilities. 
•             Image in low light (night-time) conditions.
•             Image in standard light (day-time) conditions.
•             Image in harsh weather conditions (rain, snow, smog).
•             Object detection based on multispectral data.
•             Object detection based on 3D range data.</objective>
