  <objective>"""PENTABIOL has developed and tested PROBISAN, a fermented fodder for nutrition of animals that overtakes the performance of any other fodder in the market. The most strict and unbiased product test has been undertaken on a single commercial swine farm in Spain comparing PROBISAN, DIAMOND V (the leading product in the market) and the best performing fodder ever experienced in the farm, namely PROBIO, which was a fodder specifically engineered for this farm using probiotic additives. Each fodder was used to feed during the same period of a population of 1.575 piglets (252 each fodder).PROBISAN piglets ate 3,3% less and grew 4% more than PROBIO piglets, and ate 10% less and grew 4% more than DIAMOND V piglets. Considering both effects PROBISAN offers 14% more yield than the market leader and 7,3% more yield than the best specially engineered product. Furthermore the average deviation of results with the group of 7 independent tests showed that PROBISAN is much more stable than the other fodders.""
