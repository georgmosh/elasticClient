  <objective>Development of new medicines such as chemotherapeutic drugs requires a detailed understanding of their biological mechanism of action. What are the desired and undesired interactions with biological molecules? It is our goal to found a start-up company that will provide a solution to this challenge. Using novel and ground-breaking approaches we can identify target structures and interaction partners of small bioactive molecules at an unmatched and unprecedented resolution. ERC PoC funding will be essential to support our activities to identify optimal strategies and initial customers for our service.</objective>
