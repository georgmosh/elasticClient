  <objective>RECOTRANS project will create new manufacturing system for obtaining multi-material metal composites products suitable for the transport industry; automotive, truck and railway sector. The aim of this project is to integrate unconventional manufacturing technologies such as (microwave) MW radiation and laser joining in current RTM and pultrusion production lines. This integration will contribute to obtain high quality lightweight multi-materials at high production rates; reducing production cost, energy consumption and time to market contributing to reduce CO2 emissions coming from vehicles; truck, automotive and railway</objective>
