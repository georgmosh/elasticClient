  <objective>The LIFE project is about collaborative learning from failure in entrepreneurship and collaborative actions to bring entrepreneurship forward.

Although cultural diversity is one of Europeâ€™s biggest assets, this also creates severe obstacles for entrepreneurs to scale their efforts at the pan-European level. The distributed markets, language barriers and decentralized policy leads to: lack of access to talent &amp; relevant expertise, to sufficient financing and to adequate facilities &amp; networks.

Hinged on a yearly Failing Forward conference, the project will 
- map out all the relevant stakeholders and programs in each of the partnering areas in a systematic way, making this available to all web entrepreneurs across Europe in one centralized platform,
- identify, share and discuss best practices &amp; success stories 

This yearly pan-European conference in Brussels will be complemented with local spin-off events in the partner regions, to 
-	generate and grow awareness that failure is an inherent part of the process of entrepreneurship and innovation;
-	share and celebrate the success stories that were built on incremental learning;
-	open up the existing startup support programs to web entrepreneurs from all over Europe</objective>
