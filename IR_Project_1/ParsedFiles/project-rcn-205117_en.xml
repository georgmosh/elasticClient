  <objective>Through AUTOSTRAP our company, AEQUS, aims to revolutionize the European furniture market and contribute to boost its growth by exploiting and developing the niche market of upholstered furniture, introducing a full automated strapping solution through a robotic cell. Driven by the needs of European furniture manufacturers based on increasing production and reducing costs to compete with low labour costs countries, AUTOSTRAP is the solution because will multiply production per 9 and will reduce production costs in a 40%. Besides, end-users will be benefited with a better quality and longlasting product that will prolong its lifetime from 10 - 12 years to 20 - 22 years. We want Europe to recover its lost position in furniture production and export with a high-technology solution, that will allow to recover its innovative position worldwide.Our preliminary projections of the market deployment of AUTOSTRAP in 2022 show a Return on Investment, ROI, of 3.44 for the first five years, impliying revenues of â‚¬ 15.9 million for our company.</objective>
