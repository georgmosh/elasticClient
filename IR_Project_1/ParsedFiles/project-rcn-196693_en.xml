  <objective>Sense4Care S.L. (S4C) is high-tech SME constituted in Barcelona in 2013 as a spin-off of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya - BarcelonaTech (UPC) with a clear objective: taking to the market the results of several research projects. UPC itself holds 5% of the shares of the company, and the rest belongs to professors, researchers and investors. UPC was the Coordinator and main beneficiary of the FP7-ICT project called REMPARK1 project, and has legally transferred the exploitation rights of the project results to S4C, with the aim of commercialising a product that can dramatically improve the lives of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) sufferers.

The main result from the FP7-REMPARK project is the kinetic monitor PARK-IT, which can be exploited as a standalone product. PARK-IT is a new gold-standard, continuous and quantitative monitoring medical device for assessing the status of Parkinson Disease patients. PARK-IT device, based in movement detection and complex algorithms, allows the doctors to precisely adjust the medication of PD patients, overcoming one of the main problems that PD patients face. It constitutes a disruptive innovation answering to an unmet need.

The present innovation business project is therefore focused in taking this device to the market through a clear and innovative business model.</objective>
