  <objective>Schizophrenia is a devastating disease with high societal costs. However, little is known about the biological mechanisms behind the disorder, a knowledge gap that has stalled the development of new treatments. We recently discovered that truncating mutations in RBM12, an RNA binding protein, are associated with schizophrenia. This finding provides a novel entry point to understanding the disease, but fully exploiting the discovery requires further examination of the function of RBM12. Here I propose to begin that effort by using the zebrafish model system to first, determine the role of RBM12 in brain development; second, discover the role of RBM12 in brain function as assessed by functional connectivity and behavioural assays; and third, identify RBM12â€™s direct and indirect targets using RNA-seq and iCLIP (individual-nucleotide resolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation). These studies will aid in illuminating the biological basis of schizophrenia and, ultimately, lead to novel treatments.</objective>
