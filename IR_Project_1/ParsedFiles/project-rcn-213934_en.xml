  <objective>HIRIS objective is to provide an efficient TRL 6 Flight Test Instrumentation equipment for the Main Rotor (MR), the Lateral Rotor and the Drive Shafts (DS) systems fully adapted to specific configuration and needs of the Fast Rotorcraft demonstrator. 
The innovation  comes from an hybrid solution of  proven and tested technologies, in use for legacy solutions in order to ensure energy transmission on rotating parts. 3 different devices will be developed for the Main Rotor, the Lateral Rotor and the Drive shaft systems of the Fast Rotorcraft.
For the developments, it is decisive to implement disruptive solutions for contactless and wireless instrumentation of rotary parts that will drastically improve reliability, availability and flexibility regarding legacy solutions. For an helicopter manufacturer, this may become a significant competitive advantage as rotors are the most critical parts of the aircraft. It will however, imply many modifications in the usual way to conceive solutions hence forcing to imagine an “unusual” instrumentation system. The HIRIS (Helicopter Innovative Rotating Instrumentation System) proposal offers answers to such challenge.</objective>
