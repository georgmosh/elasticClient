  <objective>As outlined in the Van Rompuy Report (2012), various potential models of monetary and fiscal union for Europe should be investigated and assessed, including different forms of shock-absorption mechanisms. In this context we explore new macroprudential policies for monetary and fiscal consolidation in the EU after the recent financial and sovereign debt crises, also in comparison with other major world economies in order to ensure long-term sustainability and the effective stabilisation of the Eurozone. Novel economic models are introduced and their applicability, forecastability, institutional characteristics and societal impact are evaluated.</objective>
