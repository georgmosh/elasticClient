  <objective>The proposed project will significantly improve the insight in the processes that have changed a comet nucleus or asteroid since their formation. These processes typically go along with activity, the observable release of gas and/or dust. Understanding the evolutionary processes of comets and asteroids will allow us to answer the crucial question which aspects of these present-day bodies still provide essential clues to their formation in the protoplanetary disc of the early solar system. 

Ground-breaking progress in understanding these fundamental questions can now be made thanks to the huge and unprecedented data set returned between 2014 and 2016 by the European Space Agencyâ€™s Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and by recent major advances in the observational study of active asteroids facilitated by the increased availability of sky surveys and follow-on observations with world-class telescopes.

The key aims of this proposal are to
- Obtain a unified quantitative picture of the different erosion processes active in comets and asteroids,
- Investigate how ice is stored in comets and asteroids,
- Characterize the ejected dust (size distribution, optical and thermal properties) and relate it to dust around other stars,
- Understand in which respects comet 67P can be considered as representative of a wider sample of comets or even asteroids.

We will follow a highly multi-disciplinary approach analyzing data from many Rosetta instruments, ground- and space-based telescopes, and connect these through numerical models of the dust dynamics and thermal properties.</objective>
