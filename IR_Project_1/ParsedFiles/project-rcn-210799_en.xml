  <acronym>I-MECH</acronym>
  <objective>The I-MECH target is to provide augmented intelligence for wide range of cyber-physical systems having actively controlled moving elements, hence support development of smarter mechatronic systems. They face increasing demands on size, motion speed, precision, adaptability, self-diagnostic, connectivity, new cognitive features, etc. Fulfillment of these requirements is essential for building smart, safe and reliable production complexes. This implies completely new demands also on bottom layers of employed motion control system which cannot be routinely handled by available commercial products. On the ground of this, the main mission of this project is to bring novel intelligence into Instrumentation and Control Layers mainly by bridging the gap between latest research results and industrial practice in related model based engineering fields. Next, I-MECH will deliver new interfaces and diagnostic data quality for System Behavior Layer. It strives to provide a cutting edge reference motion control platform for non-standard applications where the control speed, precision, optimal performance, easy reconfigurability and traceability are crucial. The high added value of I-MECH reference platform will be directly verified in high-speed/big CNC machining, additive manufacturing, semicon, high-speed packaging and healthcare robotics. In these sectors, the main project pilots will be validated. However, the platform will be applicable in many other generic motion control fields. The project outputs will impact on the entire value chain of the production automation market and, through envisioned I-MECH center, create sustainable proposition for future smart industry.</objective>
