  <objective>"The action “Establishing services enhancing the innovation management capacity of SME's in the Enterprise Europe
Network"" represents an important breakthrough in delivering the EEN services. Until now the EEN consortia partners’ role
was mainly catalyzing the SMEs innovation needs with the innovative product, services and processes provided by other
companies or research centres, with the aim of fostering their internationalization. Strengthening the target of
internationalization, the EEN consortia partners will improve their action providing on site support to SMEs, and becoming a
part of the companies for assessing their capacity in the innovation management issues. The ELSE – SIM (Enterprise Lazio
and Sardegna for Europe- SMEs Innovation Management) consortium as a whole is able to provide the expected services:
