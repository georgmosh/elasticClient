  <acronym>CleanCoat</acronym>
  <objective>CleanCoat is a radically new eco-friendly coating designed specifically for metallic exteriors on high-rise buildings. Our success formula is based on a 70%PVDF matrix with embedded TiO2 nanoparticles (innovation) that simultaneously protects the metal against corrosion, keeps the surface clean (photocatalysis) and purifies the air by reducing pollutants (NO¬x and SOx), thereby addressing EU challenges on raw materials, pollution and ozone depletion. Users of our product are specialized coil coaters (end users) and real estate (final users) who have a need for high production efficiency, cost reductions and aesthetic quality. Thanks to CleanCoats’ embedded structure and NIR curing process, production time is reduced by 50%, cost by 30% and production capacity doubled. With a 30 year guaranteed durability, real estate companies will save up to € 100.000 per year on maintenance and cleaning and enjoy a high quality aesthetic look by the self-cleaning surface, unlimited choice of colours and finishes, and outstanding colour retention and UV stability of the product.</objective>
