  <acronym>ASCENT</acronym>
  <objective>The main objective of ASCENT project is to implement the concepts and define other novel functions up to a functional demonstration (pilot in the loop simulation when relevant), in order to validate the functional requirements. 
The enhance Active Cockpit simulator enviroment shall serve as a pioneering platform test environment for testing possible future technologies that now the aeronautical industry is demanding introducing innovative concepts and ideas that might change or at least modify the operation of the simulators and training procedures of pilots and crews existing nowadays.</objective>
