  <objective>A significant bottleneck in Europeâ€™s health care model is that physicians are spending up to 30 % of their time operating complex Hospital Information Systems (HIS). The Diktamen-method totally frees the physician from HIS and revolutionizes any voice-to-text capabilities. All diagnostic data is expressed with natural language, while the error free diagnostic document is produced in real-time. Our pilot study showed that physicians treat 25 % + more patients per day with the Diktamen-method. According to our growth plan this is the equivalent of generating 13 888 new physicians inside EU-27 by the year 2020.</objective>
