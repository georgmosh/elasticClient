  <objective>Understanding properties of nanoparticles (and in general of nano-functionalized materials) and how they behave in living systems is a relatively new area of scientific study. The scientific community has not yet been able to derive harmful properties of nanomaterials from the properties of the bulk material. So a precautionary approach is required when handling and using these materials in circumstances where exposure to nanomaterials cannot be excluded. The purpose of this project is to promote good practices (i.e. by following up standards), identify gaps in methodologies and direction for further investigations in order to support risk assessment in order to protect human health. The project also aims to initiate communication with stakeholders to support informed decision making and governance of risks related to handling of nanomaterials and medical surveillance of the workforce in the semiconductor fabrication process. We will focus on several use cases. For example, the use of nanomaterials in chemical mechanical polish slurries for semiconductor manufacture is well documented; however there are also other scenarios where nanomaterials may be used or generated (e.g. wafer cleaving, cleaning of rector chambers or exhaust air ducts).</objective>
