  <objective>The HERA Joint Research Programme European Public Space, Culture and Integration (HERA JRP PS) consortium will establish a 4th joint transnational programme for multi-disciplinary research. The HERA JRP PS involves the launch of a joint Call for Proposals and a commonly-agreed two-stage evaluation process involving an independent, international Review Panel. The consortium expects to fund about 20 transnational humanities centred projects of ~1 M EUR each. 

The aim of the HERA “Public spaces” programme will be to deepen the theoretical and empirical cultural understanding of public spaces in a European context. The programme has been designed to facilitate a broad range of cultural approaches to conceptualising public space, its structural and processual formations, and its possible outcomes in terms of integration, exclusion, disintegration, fragmentation, hybridization, amalgamation or transmission. 

Twenty-four organisations from 24 EU countries have pooled a substantial amount of their humanities research funding for this new HERA JRP increasing the efficiency and impact of public funding. 

The HERA JRP PS consortium will also actively support knowledge exchange activities and stimulate wider dissemination about the valuable contributions of new humanities research. Furthermore, the HERA JRP PS will pursue additional activities aiming at international capacity-building in humanities research and explore and prepare new joint actions.</objective>
