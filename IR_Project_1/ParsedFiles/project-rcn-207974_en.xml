  <objective>Natac Biotech S.L. is the R&amp;D division of a group of 8 companies (Natac Group S.L.) with headquarters in Spain and international presence in LATAM and the USA. We are a leading biotechnology company specialized in the extraction of high added value bioactive ingredients from agriculture products. In our effort to continue innovating and expanding, the AQUOLIVE project was initiated a couple of years ago and it has become the most strategic project for us, as a way to become a leading player of the animal nutrition market. The AQUOLIVE project is aimed at offering the aquaculture sector a high-performance feed additive based on our patented formulation of bioactive phytochemicals obtained from olive oil production by-products (production method also patented). This solution will help Fish farmers to increase their productivity and profitability, while reducing the use of hazardous antimicrobial chemicals in intensive aquaculture practices. We see in the AQUOLIVE project a clear investment opportunity, in which we seek entering the fast growing aquaculture feeding market (estimated to reach €123 Billion by 2019) and achieve a 5-years cumulative cash flow of €18.23 Million meaning a 5-years ROI of 608%.</objective>
