  <objective>The first product that AURA will launch to the market will be OSCANN, a diagnosis platform that will allow better, faster
and more accurate diagnosis of neurological disorders affecting Europeâ€™s population in general, but specially youngsters
(e.g. ADHD) and elders (e.g. Parkinson). OSCANN allows for the measurement and analysis of ocular and oculocephalic
movements (OM/OCM) and combines the result with data obtained from other sources (clinical histories, medical
explorations, complementary tests and biomarkers) using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to improve significantly the
quality of medical diagnosis in early stages.</objective>
