  <objective>The ASURI project at DO3D Innovations Ltd. aims to enter the 3D – printed medical implant and surgical guide market with a 3D printing service that integrates the whole medical implant and surgical guide design and manufacturing process. Our solution is innovative, safe, fast, cost effective and unquestionable from a healthcare and regulatory perspective. The novelty of our solution lies in the integration of castable 3D printing techniques with high precision casting in the area of medical implants: traditional implant manufacturers cannot provide patient specific implants or surgical guides, while 3D-printed implant manufacturer service providers work with SLM technology, which is slower and more expensive. Key benefits of our solution are: • it provides an alternative for expensive surgical equipments or navigation systems with also keeping the level of efficiency close to them, or claiming for even higher efficiency • applying our service to hospitals having no resources for such operational equipment allows them to successfully perform more complex interventions • integrates presurgical planning in the traditional process • patient specific, taylor made surgical devices provide better treatment, faster healing process and lower rate of failure leading to an improved medical outcome • patients with complex pathologies can be treated who cannot be cured with traditional solutions • makes revisional surgeries easier •
our new DLP printing technology provides a 2-times faster printing speed than currently commercially available printers, which ensures a cost and time effective manufacturing. This project creates a Europe-wide and global business opportunity for DO3D. Our project is supported by our strategic partners as well.</objective>
