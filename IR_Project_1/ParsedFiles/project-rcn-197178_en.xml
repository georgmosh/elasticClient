  <objective>The Smart Road Modular Sensor  (SmaRMS) Prototype Testing and Commercialization Viability

The main purpose is to prepare business plan and to perform first development/testing activities for Smart Road Modular Sensor  (SmaRMS). In the first iteration the sensor will measure temperature of the road at three levels in depth and will be completely energy independent, easy to install and implement into existing Wi-Fi network and road weather information systems (RWIS). The modular nature of the sensor will in future enable the exchange of sensoric module in order to expand its application range.</objective>
