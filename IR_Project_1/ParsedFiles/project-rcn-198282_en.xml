  <objective>The continuous increase of the share of renewable energy sources is redefining the electrical networks. In future infrastructures, an important number of agents (sources, storage devices and consumers) will have intelligent interfaces allowing the regulation of the injection and extraction of power into the grid. This context will create multiple alternatives to increase the efficiency in electricity generation and consumption, to reduce energy costs and to provide a more reliable operation of electrical grids. These future networks will be only possible with suitable control algorithms. INCITE is a multi-sectoral consortium gathering experts on control and power systems, from academia and industry with the purpose of providing innovative control solutions for the future electrical networks.</objective>
