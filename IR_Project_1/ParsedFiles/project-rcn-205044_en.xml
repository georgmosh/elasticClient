  <objective>Recent studies have shown in Germany, 18,000 people died due to hospital errors. This number was even higher in the
United States. Tracing this preventable problem to the source, we found that our surgeons, doctors, and medical students
still participate in traditional ineffective means of learning. Students are put through years of lectures while never fully
engaging in practice. When the students are finally allowed in the surgery room, it is only to witness and they miss the point
of view of the surgeon. In response, Revinax has created VR4Health project that exploits the idea of using interactive virtual
reality as a training method. Revinax’s process consists in: 1.Record the surgeries using a state-of-the-art camera rig that
enables the surgeon’s point of view, 2.Edition of the video/audio, 3.Transferring the video into a software app compatible for
smart devices 4. Additional integrated e-learning options like Observer feature (for interactivity between trainer and students)
and pedagogical contents (tests, anatomical atlas, etc) . Studies prove that the introduction of virtual reality into surgical
training is superior to conventional training allowing undivided focus, an emotional connection, and adaptation to real life
experiences, all in the surgeon’s point of view. The emerging e-learning market is growing rapidly with the growth of the
market almost expected to double in the next 5 years. We have developed an innovative solution that will greatly improve
surgical training allowing to decrease surgical errors, and the associated burden for EU healthcare systems. At the same
time VR4Health will boost the growth of Revinax to get estimated profits of €13.28M by 2016 and achieve a headcount
growth of 23new employees. Additionally, we plan to gradually expand VR4Health to other continents and eventually
participate in an UNESCO sponsored project to provide better surgical education in African and Asian countries.</objective>
