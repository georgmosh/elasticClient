  <acronym>Sniper-ARM</acronym>
  <objective>The goal of this project is to extend the Sniper architectural simulator, previously developed at Ghent University, towards ARM-based systems. Sniper is shown to be fast, accurate and low-complexity for x86 multicore systems; and it is widely used in academia, as well as in industry for high-performance computing processor systems. This project will enhance Sniper to support ARM-based systems and will explore innovation opportunities in the embedded and mobile markets.</objective>
