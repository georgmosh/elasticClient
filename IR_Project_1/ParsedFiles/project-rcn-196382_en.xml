  <acronym>WINTHERWAX</acronym>
  <objective>M SORA and SILVAPRODUKT, two Slovenian SMEs dedicated to wood products and wood preservation present WINTHERWAX, a passive window made out of Norway spruce (Picea alba).  It’s thermally treated wood is processed through the unique SILVAPRO patented process, and coated with an innovative preservative wax. 
The result is a wooden passive window cost-effective (the window will be sold at a price of 369€, beating the competitors), highly durable (class 1, more than 25 years fully exposed in the environment), that provides an excellent thermal insulation being highly energy efficient (Thermal transmittance = 0,09 (W/m2K)). It is eco-friendly (its innovative coating, which is a unique biocide-free wax that reduces cracking which is the main cause for wood decay), and with a high aesthetic value (the translucent wax allows this product to preserve the natural look of the wood, in contrast to current oils and varnishes).
The aim is to capture 4,1% of the wooden passive window market share from the EU.</objective>
