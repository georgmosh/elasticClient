  <objective>The objective of the SPOTVIEW project is to develop and demonstrate innovative, sustainable and efficient processes and technology components, in order to optimize the use of natural resources, especially water, in three industrial sectors (Dairy, Pulp and Paper and Steel) contributing to 44% of industrial water usage in EU. This resource optimization (including water, energy, raw materials and additives) is a key issue to maintain production competitiveness and sustainability. A total of 14 existing and new technologies will be assessed during the project, including solid/liquid separation, ultrafiltration, deionization, biological treatment, disinfection and chemical heat pump. The technology components will be assessed in simulated or operational environment for 9 new water management practices in the three industrial sectors. Up to 7 selected technologies demonstrators are planned in real industrial environment. The implemented process and technology will be evaluated in terms of environmental impacts and benefits, generated by achieving the SPOTVIEW targets (20% to 90% reduction of water usage, wastewater emissions, chemicals and energy use). The SPOTVIEW consortium covers the whole value chain, from technology development, assessment, supply and industrial applications in each targeted sector. Economic exploitation of the proposed technologies is pursued through a well described business case scenario and market penetration strategy. The market opportunities for future services and technology products beyond the SPOTVIEW project will generate up to 2800 new equipment and 7000 new jobs in Europe. The expected gains for the industrial sectors generated by the recovery of by-products and by energy, chemicals and additives savings represent annually 1.53b€ for Europe. The generated production capacity increase by companies has been estimated at 22.8b€. Dissemination and training activities are planned to maximize the impact of the project.</objective>
