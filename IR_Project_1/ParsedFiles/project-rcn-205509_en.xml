  <objective>The overall purpose of the proposal LIPES, Life Integrated Process for the Enzymatic Splitting of triglycerides, is dedicated to the first market replication of greener and healthier fatty acids motivated by an increasing market demand and driven by stricter legislation. LIPES aims to perform the scale-up to pre-industrial level of a new environmentally friendly alternative to the traditional and current splitting routes of triglyceride producing free fatty acids and glycerol, thus at a lower variable and investment costs and in very resource-efficient way with a minimum saving of 45% water consumption, 70% of enzymes and 80% of energetic consumption.</objective>
