  <objective>We investigate  the versal unfolding and bifurcations of planar polynomial differential systems having some topological structure. Specially,  we classify the systems of high degree which have centers  or degenerate equilibria. Then we study the  degeneracy of the system and prove the existence of versal unfoldings. All possible bifurcations of  unfolding  systems will be discussed and  topological phase portraits of the systems are presented.  Finally, we give a rigourous mathematical explanation for our results in some bio-mathematical models.</objective>
