  <acronym>GO2</acronym>
  <objective>The main objective of GO2 project will be focused on the development and further commercialization of an innovative system able to produce high purity oxygen (&gt;&gt;99.5%) at high temperature (1000ÂºC) by means of advanced membrane modules (high temperature ion conducting ceramic membranes). KERIONICS products are able to supply oxygen with a cost reduction between 20-80% regarding the current technologies for industrial applications that requires oxygen or enriched air and to capture CO2 using the most efficient technology. GO2 project will have a major impact on European industry because the use of oxygen or enriched air improves the plant efficiency and GO2 technology can reduce CO2 emissions by means of the reduction in fuel consumption using technically efficient CO2 separation. Energy-intensive industry processes based on combustion and oxidation at high temperature can achieve an impressive 24-month payback using this technology.</objective>
