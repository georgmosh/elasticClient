  <objective>LaBionicS aims at both commercializing and industrializing a surface laser processing approach for biomimetic surface texturing developed during LiNaBioFlud project. This approach provides controlled formation functional  (micro-/nano- structured) surface textures that mimic skin structures found in different animals and insects (biomimetic surfaces). More specifically the project will use the advanced laser-processing strategies, developed during the LiNaBioFLuid project, based on self-organization of material surface, to mimic the specific topography of the integument of bark bugs, sharks, butterfly wings and moisture harvesting lizards.  Our investigations gave strong indications that these nano-features play an important role for the functionalizing surface in engineering applications relevant to Directional Fluid transport, Antibacterial / Antifouling, Antireflectance, Drag reduction, Friction Reduction, Self Cleaning and Water repellency. Beside these main advantageous functionalities, the approach has enormous versatility for modulating the final biomimetic properties and applicability in a real industrial line. 

The project will follow an open innovation approach with three main enablers for commercializing and industrializing the technology. There are three main  enablers/themes that will facilitate the work of the LaBionicS project that will enable the funneling of different ideas into viable highly potential commercial applications.</objective>
