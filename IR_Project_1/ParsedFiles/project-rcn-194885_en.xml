  <objective>Smart Mature Resilience (SMR) will develop and validate Resilience Management Guidelines, using three pilot projects covering different CI security sectors, as well as climate change and social dynamics. The Resilience Management Guidelines will provide a robust shield against man-made and natural hazards, enabling society to resist, absorb, accommodate to and recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner, including through the preservation and restoration of essential structures and functions. A set of tools operationalize crucial interdependent supporting structures of the Resilience Management Guidelines: 1) a Resilience Maturity Model defining the trajectory of an entity through measurable resilience levels; 2) a Systemic Risk Assessment Questionnaire that, beyond assessing the entity’s risk, determines its resilience maturity level; 3) a portfolio of Resilience Building Policies that enable the entity’s progression towards higher maturity levels; 4) a System Dynamics Model allowing to diagnose, monitor and explore the entity’s resilience trajectory as determined by resilience building policies, and, 5) a Resilience Engagement and Communication Tool to integrate the wider public in community resilience, including public-private cooperation.
Beyond delivering the validated Resilience Management Guidelines and the five supporting tools, the SMR project establishes a European Resilience Backbone consisting of vertebrae (adopters, from fully committed through direct project participation to alerted potential adopters). 
The SMR project’s powerful impact maximizing measures will assist the implementation of the Resilience Management Guidelines by consolidating the resilience vertebrae as mutually supporting functional units of the European Resilience Backbone.
The five tools operationalizing the five crucial interdependent supporting structures of the Resilience Management Guidelines will be commercialized, targeting users in Europe and beyond</objective>
