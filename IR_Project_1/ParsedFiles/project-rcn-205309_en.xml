  <objective>The Peroxiredoxin proteins represent a currently untapped molecular therapeutic target. We recently characterised a range
of novel chemical compounds that could alter the function of one of the peroxiredoxin family members, peroxiredoxin 4
(PRDX4). The approach involved high-throughput computational “virtual” compound screening involving our supercomputer
facility at the University of Cambridge. Given our success in finding chemicals that could affect the function of these
proteins, we would now like to screen and provide proof-of-principle evidence of the efficacy of novel compounds for further
development as therapeutic agents.

This process has been very rapid for prototyping novel molecules, from idea to hit compound validation in biological assays
in less than 6 months. This rapid development cycle is highly cost-efficient and produces a range of chemical “hits” that
could subsequently be taken forward as “lead” compounds for pre-clinical and clinical studies in the future, as novel
therapeutics for a range of diseases ranging from cardiovascular and metabolic disease to cancer.</objective>
