  <objective>We want to prepare the commercialisation of a novel clinical diagnostic test for the status of the immune system – the mechanical haemogram – with the purpose of improving the therapy management of severe infections, in particular in case of sepsis. Sepsis is ranked the third most common cause of death worldwide, and represents one of the most challenging problems even in modern health care systems. Our test is based on the analysis of single cell mechanical properties of white blood cells found in peripheral blood. Those properties serve as functional biomarker for the activation status of the immune system. With this test, we aim to provide an early detection of sepsis and direct monitoring of treatment effects for an efficient therapy management. The goal of the proposed project is to create and evaluate a business case for the successful implementation of this in vitro diagnostic test for clinical application in sepsis management.</objective>
