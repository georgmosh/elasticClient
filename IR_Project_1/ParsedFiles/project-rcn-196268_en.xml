  <objective>The opportunity to focus on the production of biopharmaceuticals is often taken from SMEs since huge amount of resources is required for the development of high-producer cell lines. We envision that our parental cell factories will increase the efficiency of cell line engineering and will effectively reduce the time-to-market for mammalian cell-based products. It allows SMEs to leverage their traditional strengths of adaptability and creativity, and to develop novel products for biotechnology industries.</objective>
