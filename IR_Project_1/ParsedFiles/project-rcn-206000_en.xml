  <objective>Patient Empowerment

Individualized tackling of unnecessary stress, in particular when related to healthcare procedures, promises to enhance the autonomy and quality of life of many people and yield a significant contribution to self-empowerment, thus relieving careers and related persons from personal assistance. Not at least, also a considerable economic relief (see Impact).

This is the topic the STARS consortium is determined to deal with. Of course, as will be shown, the objective is complex and ambitious and has to meet challenges from smart vital signs measuring to wireless real-time transfer of large data amounts to big data management. Nevertheless, concerning the expectable positive impact there is a large potential of revenue for the efforts. And, regarding present technological progress, it seems absolutely feasible to face this challenge when doing this inby a concerted, multidisciplinary, cross-linked effort.  

To achieve the aim, our proposal addresses an advanced, eHealth based concept for tailored avoidance and/or reduction of healthcare related stress, beginning as early as in the preclinical phase, proceeding during their hospitalisation until the end of the aftercare period. I.a. it can be expected that, recovery time will be shortened, harmful side-effects of sedating drugs will be prevented and costs will be reduced, which in sum will be an important contribution to a cost-effective healthcare system in the next decades.</objective>
