  <objective>“Researchers for Humanity 2016-2017” will continue the series of events already organized in Romania from 2007, building a strong link between public and research through this important message of relevance: what science and researchers do are useful for daily life, and their life is as everyone’s elses. 

Important players from science and education will join forces in creating the most important national wide project that is inviting the public to come, play, talk and learn about researchers and to understand how science can be used in the benefit of humanity. Based on the outstanding awareness of the European dimension of the event that we created throughout the years, Researchers Night 2016-2017 will confirm as being one of the most important communication event for research and education institutions. Little by little and year after year, a national platform was made, and new cities will join us so that every researcher or teacher or student  that wants to create an event for promoting researchers in their area to be able to join and get involved, being aligned with the national strategy. 

The event itself will be organized by us in 1 important location of 15 major, medium and small cities from all over Romania.  Also, through the platform, we will invite associated events to get enrolled and be supported by us through promotion at the national level.  We aim to reach 50000 qualitative interactions, over 150 researchers, students and teachers and over 500000 prs to be exposed to the awareness campaign. The logo will assemble with the old one in order to create a link with previous years and awareness of the European and national dimension of the event.

Partnerships will be continued at national and local level (also with one of the most important TV stations in Romania). The main novelty of the project will be the component of private research through private companies and NGOs that are implementing various research projects.</objective>
