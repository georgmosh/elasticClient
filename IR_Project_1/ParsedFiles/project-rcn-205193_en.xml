  <objective>The VOLT Consortium will develop an innovative high voltage network (using 270 VDC) inspired by a Clean Sky architecture. This new architecture requires an innovative battery solution that will provide mainly pre-flight and starting power to the rotorcraft
The objective of  VOLT is to demonstrate their ability to:
• Propose to the aeronautical industry an innovative battery concept for a High Voltage Network battery (HVNB) using an array of commercial available off-the-shelf battery cells with smart controllers rather than a single massive specific cell thus providing a far more reliable approach than classic solutions
• Design, develop and manufacture a battery prototype (TRL6) and charger according to the technical, physical, and stringent environment requirements as defined in the call text
• Perform the necessary stringent battery testing required before being qualified for flight testing and provide a monitoring and troubleshooting software easily used by unqualified operators
• Prepare in parallel to the above mentioned research work performed in this project, the necessary pre-industrialization work to be able to meet future production demands of the VOLT battery.</objective>
