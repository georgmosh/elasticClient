  <acronym>NANO2DAY</acronym>
  <objective>NANO2DAY is aiming at the development of advanced multifunctional composites with outstanding electronic and mechanical properties by incorporation of novel MXene nanosheets into polymer matrixes. The project will firstly go forward to the rational design and systematic exploration of MXene-polymer nanocomposites for wearable electronics and advanced structural components for airspace applications. This will be achieved by i) intersectoral consolidation and sharing of knowledge and expertise of 11 members from Europe and USA working in different areas and ii) collaborative research on the development and assessment of novel materials, including technology, characterisation, modelling, and validation. The concept explored in the project accounts for finding and extending the application potential of MXene-doped polymers and validation of their effectiveness compared to well-known graphene-doped polymers. The innovative aspects followed in the project are based on up-scaling of novel technologies for “close-to-industrial” synthesis of MXenes and MXene-doped polymer masterbatches and implementation of MXenes into design of structural polymer composites, including FRPs. NANO2DAY will essentially contribute to the integration of scientific insights into innovation-based industrial environment and successful implementation of novel advanced materials into practical applications.</objective>
