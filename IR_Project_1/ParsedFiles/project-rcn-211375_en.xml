  <acronym>World RePORT</acronym>
  <objective>The World RePORT is a database mapping the biomedical research projects supported by the major funders. It illustrates where the research is taking place. The World RePORT had an initial Pilot Phase focused only in sub-Saharan Africa (2011 â€“ 2013). This initial version was upgraded in 2016 to make it more user-friendly and easier to search, with charts to summarize the information; to include all the regions of the World; to improve search; to add automatic statistics; to include filters to highlight research in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs); and to improve performance in accommodating the larger number of records (Phase 1). Phase 1 was intended to enhance and upgrade the existing World RePORT beta website and database. The overall objective of Phase 2, presented in this proposal, is to enhance the user experience by adding a rich interface and an integration mechanism/workflow for funding organizations to upload their own data, and to add more visualizations and other enhancements, while keeping the overall site responsive to and compliant with the latest technologies.</objective>
