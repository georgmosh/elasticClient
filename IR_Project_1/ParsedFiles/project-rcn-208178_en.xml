  <objective>Dwarfbody-Therapeutics (DB-Tx) is a new company, established in 2016 as a spin off from a frontrunner research team in Gastro-Intestinal Cancers in the AMC Amsterdam. DB-Tx aims to transform current, ineffective treatment of these aggressive cancer types by co-administering highly effective and safe low molecular weight antibodies (“Dwarfbodies®”) to significantly increase therapeutic outcome.  The superiority of the Dwarfbodies® compared to competing molecules and their anticancer effects have been published in various high ranked journals. Now PANTREAT primarily aims at broadening the initial target market for the Dwarfbodies® by creating additional proof-of-concept, reports on production, test Trial Centers and a sound business plan. Results will be compiled into a sound company portfolio, which will form the basis for further development of the Dwarfbodies® and obtaining investments and supportive grants and partnerships. Finally, this will lead to highly attractive licencing deals from 2020 onwards.</objective>
