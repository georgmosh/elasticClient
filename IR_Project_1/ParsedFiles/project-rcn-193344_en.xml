  <objective>Science with and for Society has a vital role to play in bringing together a wide range of stakeholders in order to build capacities and develop innovative ways to connect science to society through Responsible Research and Innovation measures. This demands that the Science with and for Society National Contact Points (NCPs) are able to orientate in the wide area of policy behind the programme, its topics and research areas as well as in Horizon 2020 rules and regulations and in addition, they need to have extensive knowledge of the different groups of stakeholders, in order to be able to fulfil their job. The proposal focuses on identifying and sharing good practices and raising the standard of proposals by organising joint activities of NCPs. The consortium ensures a balance of experienced NCPs and newcomers in order to build on knowledge and enhance skills and competences of all NCPs within the programme. This will result in more consistent and improved NCP services which will enhance participation in Science with and for Society calls.</objective>
