  <acronym>AllerScreening</acronym>
  <objective>Food allergy is an immune-based disease that has become an important public health problem that affects children and adults and may be increasing in prevalence.In the US, food allergy affects 5% of children under the age of 5 years and 4% of teens and adults, and its prevalence appears to be on the increase. Globally, it is estimated that over 6% of the population, around 200 to 250 million people, suffer from some food allergies, affecting more than 17 million people only in Europe.

The main objective of this proposal is translating an optical diagnostic technology already proven in which the novel AllerScreening platform is based on, to the clinical routine, addressing a priority healthcare unmet need from the laboratory to the clinic. The unique features of AllerScreening will allow clinicians to early detect main food allergies (at least the 90% of European food allergies) through a simple test using a drop of sera, reducing the cost and technical requirements of the current clinical practice. This new and innovative cost-effective sensing system for the in vitro component diagnosis of food allergies will be feasible thanks to the multiplexed disposable BioKits and the optical Pont-of-Care (PoC) reader in which the novel AllerScreening platform is based on, allowing the adoption of a novel PoC diagnostic device specific for food allergies.</objective>
