  <objective>GENDERACTION will create an innovative policy community for the implementation of the gender priority in the European Research Area (ERA) by setting up a network of representatives appointed by national authorities in 13 Member States (MS) and Associated Countries, with 5 associate partners. The objective is to facilitate networking and exchange among more and less experienced countries to develop knowledge and build capacities, competences and know-how for gender equality and mainstreaming in research and innovation (R&amp;I) among a variety of European and national stakeholders. The network will (1) map, monitor and assess implementation of actions in priority 4 gender equality and gender mainstreaming in national ERA roadmaps of the participating countries and benchmark them against the ERA roadmap; (2) foster exchange and mutual learning among representatives of national authorities in order to achieve policy coordination in priority 4; (3) provide interactive trainings to relevant stakeholders such as national authorities, RFOs and RPOs and NCPs with a view to building competences in priority 4; (4) give strategic advice to key stakeholders to achieve gender equality in R&amp;I in Europe; (5) foster the inclusion of gender equality in international science cooperation (supporting the work of relevant ERA-related groups). The network will cooperate closely with the Helsinki Group on Gender in Research and Innovation. Iterative dissemination, engagement and impact evaluation strategies drive all planned activities. GENDERACTIONâ€™s impact will be (1) a robust policy process to implement gender equality in R&amp;I; (2) foster policy coordination among MS and with Horizon 2020, (3) greater consistency of gender equality policies and actions across Europe; and (4) enhanced integration of gender equality in international cooperation in R&amp;I. Implementation will be assisted by two Advisory Boards, on ERA priority 4 implementation and on Gender in international cooperation in STI.</objective>
