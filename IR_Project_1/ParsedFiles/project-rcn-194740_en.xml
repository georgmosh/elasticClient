  <acronym>REBOOT</acronym>
  <objective>The REBOOT project aims to significantly improve the competitiveness of European urban bus operators through the development of a retrofit all-electric drive system that replaces diesel engines. The objectives of our project include:

• To develop a retrofit all-electric drive system, battery and recharger pack for an 18 tonne bus that weighs less than 2.2 tonnes (the weight of a diesel drive) with the capacity to travel 160km  
• A final system price of €120,000 that delivers a payback to the operator within 3 years
• To deliver an 80% reduction in fuel operating cost for bus operators 
In Phase 1, our objectives include: 
• Conduct market sounding activities with at least 10 organisations comprising of customers, regulators and industry experts 
• Identify and establish strategic partnerships with at least 3 European industry partners in our value chain and 2 research institutions capable of enhancing the development and commercialisation of REBOOT
• Identify and secure at least 1 location and operator for the pilot trial / demonstration of REBOOT 
• Evaluate an initial technology concept design using a design simulation package
• Conduct a comprehensive review of the IP landscape and identify management strategies</objective>
