  <objective>Here we present an original design of a compact and portable set-up able to generate very broadband (70-100 nm at 300 nm) and powerful (&gt;1uJ/pulse) ultrashort deep-UV pulses. Compared with other schemes, it guarantees an aberration-free propagation, an easy installation and minimal dispersion. The present project aims to bring the current prototype to the level of a commercial device. The conceived design will allow to manufacture a compact, portable and cost effective device, which will be user-friendly and with almost no required maintenance. 
There is no such a source commercially available and the schemes proposed in scientific literature require an advanced level of competence in optics and laser physics, are not cost effective and unsuitable for industrial applications. 
There is thus a need of sources for ultrafast broadband radiation in the deep-UV to advance and enable new ultrafast science and extend into this spectral range the technological application of ultrafast laser sources. The implementation of the proposed device will definitively fill this gap.</objective>
