  <objective>Patient availability is one of the key elements associated with the successful execution of rare disease drug trials, and at the same time a major bottleneck that increases drug development time and cost. Patient recruitment is responsible for 25-30% of the total costs of a clinical trial, for adding substantially to the duration of a trial, and for the failure of 1 in 3 Phase 3 clinical trials. Decodeon aims to transform this bottleneck into a major node in the value chain by developing and deploying structured and efficient patient registries for pharma companies and Contract Research Organisations (CROs). In doing so, Decodeon aims to overhaul this major inefficiency in clinical trial management, while tapping into an unexplored market worth â‚¬2.5 billion.
Currently, big pharma tenders clinical trials to CROs, who perform a trial for e.g. a lump sum. Decodeon will provide CROs with rare disease patients who have pre-consented with inclusion in a clinical trial, filtered based on the specific inclusion/exclusion criteria of the trial, and at the required numbers. As a consequence, CRO efficiency will increase, through lowering the time required for patient recruitment and the associated costs. Support for our novel platform is demonstrated through letters of support, annexed to this proposal.</objective>
