  <objective>Secure computation is a general-purpose tool for processing sensitive data without compromising its
confidentiality or integrity. In recent years, significant research efforts have been invested in optimizing
and implementing secure computation protocols and related cryptographic primitives such as fully
homomorphic encryption and program obfuscation.
The proposed project will explore new techniques for secure computation and related primitives.
The new techniques are expected to enhance the asymptotic and concrete efficiency of current solutions
and extend the known relations between secure computation and other problems in cryptography and
computational complexity theory. The research will span the following directions:
• Succinct secure computation via homomorphic secret sharing, exploring new research directions
that were opened by recent works of the PI;
• Protecting protocols against malicious parties, with relevance to efficient general-purpose program
obfuscation;
• Protecting protocols against general information leakage</objective>
