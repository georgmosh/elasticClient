  <acronym>SRSensor</acronym>
  <objective>Industrial processes demand large quantities of energy and other expensive resources. optiQgain introduces a breakthrough, real-time, lightweight, cost effective, IoT based, on-site system for high resolution molecular level analysis. This revolutionary analyser utilises a Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) spectrophotometer system which produces a high resolution Raman spectrum in 0.1 second. The innovative molecular analysis delivered can be adopted in multiple fields to optimise industrial processes and offer high resource efficiency and huge cost savings. optiQgain will initially target biogas production and electricity generation, where pain and potential savings are substantial, and since many players in this industry are actively seeking new innovative technologies for sustainable success, as part of the intensively evolving Industrial I.o.T revolution. Within the overall innovation project, optiQgain aims to finalise the industrial design of the SRSensor system for improved accuracy; optimise the process for adoption in biogas production; perform a quality demonstration and validation of the SRS technology and develop a sound commercialisation and market strategy.</objective>
