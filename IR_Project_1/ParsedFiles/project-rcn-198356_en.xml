  <objective>The key objective of the MEMERE project is the design, scale-up and validation of a novel membrane reactor for the direct conversion of methane into C2H4 with integrated air separation. The focus of the project will be on the air separation through novel MIEC membranes integrated within a reactor operated at high temperature for OCM allowing integration of different process steps in a single multifunctional unit and achieving much higher yields compared with conventional reactor .

To achieve this MEMERE aims at developing novel, cheap yet more resistant oxygen selective membranes (target costs &lt; 5000â‚¬/m2) for efficient air separation and distributive oxygen feeding to the reactor. The objective is to give a robust proof of concept and validation of the technology (TRL 5) of the new technology by designing, building, operating and validating a prototype module based on the OCM technology that will be integrated in a mini-plant built in containers. MEMERE technology will deliver direct conversion of methane to C2+ with a reduced energy penalty in a much effective way (target C2 yields &gt;30%) as compared to currently available techniques contributing to the implementation of the Roadmap and Implementation Plan for process intensification of the SET-Plan. Additionally, as air integration is integrated in an efficient way in the reactor, the MEMERE technology can be used a small scales to convert methane produced in remote areas where conventional technologies cannot be exploited.</objective>
