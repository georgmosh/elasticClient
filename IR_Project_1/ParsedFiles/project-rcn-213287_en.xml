  <objective>The Danish SME CSR Research aims to pursue a major opportunity through the maturation of a social based online platform – CHARITY 24-7 – that promotes simultaneously the online consumers’ surveys and charity donations. CHARITY 24-7 approach is based on a shared value business model that joins (i) the need for consumer’s data by consumer goods retailers/manufacturers/service companies from different sectors, (ii) the engagement of surveys participants and (iii) the need for donations by NGOs and charity organisations. 
Our plan with the current Phase 1 project is to validate the segments and geographic areas that will bring more value to CHARITY 24-7 at this stage – i.e. the ones with larger potential to trigger a chain-reaction, leading us faster to the critical mass goal. Other objectives include the business model validation and establishment of pricing strategy. Moreover, the end-user’s requirements and preferences will be established and the platform extra features defined.
The implementation of the innovation project will place CSR Research ApS in a strong position to exploit a market potential over five years exceeding €15M aggregated revenues. The total donations are expected to reach €4.7M and the tendency is to increase as CHARITY 24-7 is deployed.</objective>
