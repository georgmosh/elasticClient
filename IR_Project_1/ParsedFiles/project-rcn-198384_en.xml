  <objective>I - Over forty million workers in the EU are affected by work-place related musculoskeletal disorders, as a result of working in painful or tiring positions and handling heavy loads with repetitive hand or arm movements.
II - The aging population is growing fast and approaching the mean age where loss of function and hence loss of mobility is to begin. In addition to diabetic and obesity, in 5 years’ time, there will be significant increase in number of elderly people who require mobility aids or orthoses which need to be fitted in order to enable population to live at their home independently.
III - A number of neuromuscular disorders, along with other pathologies such as arthrogryposis, affect children motor patterns in the limbs causing motion deficits.

To achieve long term benefits for the European society, the proposal addresses those three groups with the development of a next generation of Movement Assistive Devices (MADs): innovative, “passive” and highly customized kineto-dynamic equipment, built to provide natural compensation of human movements (both upper and lower limbs). MADs will be conceived and developed exploiting a generative design approach (capable to combine unique morphological characteristics with personalized kinematics) coupled with an innovative additive multi-material technology (capable to deliver specific mechanical properties),

By delivering products for mobility enhancement of the older persons, the project directly contributes in dealing with familiar ageing society issues by decreasing the need of care sector and enhancing a reduction of falls with an overall consequent saved costs. In workplace safety, the MAD fosters correct kinesis, injury prevention and improved productivity. Meanwhile, placing focus on the last, third group, MovAiD promotes the final stage of a modern sustainable society by augmenting the quality of life of its youngest members with difficulties in mobility.</objective>
