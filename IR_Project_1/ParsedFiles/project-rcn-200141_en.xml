  <acronym>Liqbiopsens</acronym>
  <objective>The overall aim of LIQBIOPSENS project is the further development and validation in real settings of a novel diagnostic platform for the early and fast detection of ctDNA and their KRAS and BRAF mutations associated to colorectal cancer through blood samples. The main features of LIQBIOPSENS are: reliability (detection rates vary from 95–100 %), low-cost (40-50 € per sample analysis), sensitivity (in the zM range), multiplexing capabilities (analysis of 27 KRAS and BRAF mutations simultaneously), short analysis time (30-60 min.), user-friendly interface and flexibility. Solution proposed by the LIQBIOPSENS project relies on the multidisciplinary integration of different Key Enabled Technologies: microelectronics, microfluidics, nanomaterials and genomics. In particular, LIQBIOPSENS platform is based on the integration of two novel complementary technologies. On the one hand, the revolutionary DGL© technology property of DestiNA Genomics Ltd, capable of delivering faster, more error-free detection of nucleic acids and their mutations than current enzyme-based detection systems, making 'false positive' results a thing of the past. On the other hand, a novel high resolution acoustic wave microsensor technology property of AWSensors, that allows an accurate, inexpensive, label-free, direct and real time transduction method to quantitatively evaluate the results of the application of the above mentioned DGL© technique.</objective>
