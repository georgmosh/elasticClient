  <objective>Influenza is a major public health problem. In a conservative estimate, influenza infects annually 60 of the 500 million inhabitants of the EU. Vaccines are the cornerstone for preventing influenza and its consequences. Current influenza vaccines have a moderate variable effect, given the mismatch between vaccine and circulating strains, waning immunity and interference from previous vaccination, among others.

The single most important challenge in achieving VE studies for the various influenza vaccines put every year on the European market is the ability of the different stakeholders to work in collaboration.

To enable a sustainable network of influenza vaccine VE studies, the Development of Robust and Innovative Vaccines Effectiveness (DRIVE) main goal will be the development of a governance model between public and private entities. This model will ensure scientific independence in the studies and full transparency, allowing different stakeholders to fulfill their needs taking into account their respective obligations and statutes.

A second challenge will be to reach the capacity to perform vaccine brand- specific effectiveness studies, which is agile enough to deliver the needed outputs in timely manner, and robust enough to provide results by different age and risk groups and flexible enough to utilize novel tools while at the same time aims to be sustainable.

Combining these outputs, DRIVE will establish a sustainable platform for joint influenza vaccine effectiveness evaluation which will have a positive impact on European citizens public health.</objective>
