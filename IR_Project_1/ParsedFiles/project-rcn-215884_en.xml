  <objective>Smart and inclusive mobility is important in many societal contexts. People with reduced mobility are proven to be one of the most neglected groups in society. They experience accessibility problems and difficulties in performing routine tasks on a daily basis. For example, what may be a simple activity to many, such as shopping, can become very complex and time consuming.
The WiiGO is an autonomous and self-driven device that follows a specific user or can be programmed to move independently. The robotic system uses the latest technology in image recognition, machine learning and artificial intelligence so that it can track users while identifying and avoiding any obstacle in its way. By functioning as an autonomous shopping cart, the developed solution supports users with reduced mobility, reducing their reliance on other people to help them with day-to-day activities. Given its autonomy and its capacity to guide and record information, the WiiGO is a flexible system that can lend itself to many applications.
Within the overall project, Follow Inspiration intend to optimise the functional design, conduct pilot tests, demonstrating the WiiGO in different retail environments, and fully establish the commercialisation strategy.</objective>
