  <acronym>STREAM</acronym>
  <objective>STREAM is a 4-year multi-site training network that aims at career development of Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) on
scientific design, construction manufacturing and of advanced radiation instrumentation. STREAM targets the development
of innovative radiation-hard, smart CMOS sensor technologies for scientific and industrial applications. The platform
technology developed within the project will be tested in the demanding conditions posed by the CERN LHC detectorsâ€™
environment as well as European industry leaders in field of CMOS imaging, electron microscopy and radiation sensors.
This leveraging factor will allow to fine-tune the technology to meet the requirements of industrial application cases on
demand such as electron microscopy and medical X-ray imaging, as well as pathway towards novel application fields such
as satellite environments, industrial X-ray systems and near-infrared imaging. The project will train a new generation of
creative, entrepreneurial and innovative early-stage researchers and widen their academic career and employment
opportunities. The STREAM consortium is composed of 10 research organisations and 5 industrial partners; the network will
provide training to 17 ESRs. STREAM structures the research and training in four scientific work-packages which span the
whole value-chain from research to application: CMOS Technologies Assessment, Smart Sensor Design and Layout,
Validation and Qualification, Technology Integration, and Valorization.</objective>
