  <objective>Playmoss (www.playmoss.com) is a music platform and community of music lovers, with more than 300,000 active monthly users. Currently, Playmoss is developing Playmoss Pro, a new service which will allow music artists to create groups of fans 2.0 and to share exclusive content with them, such as pre-releases of new songs and music videos, pre-announcements of news, discounts on tickets, discounts on merchandising or video in streaming. In exchange the fan segment known to the music industry as “super-fan” will pay 2 - 3 € to access such content.</objective>
