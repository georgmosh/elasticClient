  <objective>EcoDA investigates methods for co-designing platforms that can stimulate collective civic actions of urban resilience and enhance the capacities of urban residents to become resilient. The project focuses on food practices as case studies of resilient actions and tests a hybrid platform in three European cities – London, Paris and Bucharest. The research has three main objectives: 1) to examine the social, cultural, political and technological contexts for urban resilience, and map existing civic initiatives around resilient food practices in the three selected cities; 2) to co-design, prototype, test and refine open source digital platforms that could enable such civic initiatives to take place and/or expand, and enhance resilience capacities for citizens; and 3) to evaluate the capacity of these co-designed platforms to generate forms of public participation and urban governance that can stimulate actions of urban resilience. To address these objectives, the research will be carried out through design practice, through secondments within three professional practices working in the area of urban resilience, in the three elected cities. The methodology includes traditional qualitative methods (e.g., interviews), participatory action research, co-design experiments and collaborative workshops. The innovative and original aspects of EcoDA offer significant value in the context of the Horizon 2020 EU Programme, by addressing areas of special focus (e.g., sustainable food security and waste management) and key objectives (e.g. boosting industry engagement and supporting innovation). Moreover, the practice-based research approach, the open-source nature of the platform and the provision of the ‘metadata’ needed to enable the platform, will facilitate the up-scaling and up-taking of EcoDA’s outcomes in various cities across Europe and possibly further away, thus enabling collaborations beyond the term of the project.</objective>
