  <objective>EPIC proposes a Programme Support Activity which will produce a clear integrated roadmap &amp; masterplan for its implementation through a Strategic Research Cluster (SRC) on In-space Electrical Propulsion &amp; Station-Keeping.
EPIC plans to do a survey of the current worldwide Electric Propulsion (&amp; related) technologies &amp; their TRL. A collection of requirements from all stakeholders will be done, also assessing potential future missions. Both tasks will build on the 2014 EP Harmonisation &amp; the consultation will be expanded to all EU actors. This will allow to focus efforts on the SRC roadmap’ specific goals.
Based on this work, a critical gap analysis of technologies &amp; needs will be done, to create the basis for selection of candidate SRC developments, oriented to satisfy short-term (incremental advances) &amp; medium/long term (disruptive) needs.
Then the prioritisation will be the driver &amp; challenge, leading to the selection of activities for an SRC roadmap &amp; masterplan for its implementation, aiming at a validation flight in 2023 &amp; to contribute to European leadership in EP technologies.
EPIC will provide a solid &amp; widely consulted advice to the EC on the call texts for operational grants &amp; continuous support to EC/REA to maximise the SRC success. EPIC will analyse the SRC progress, evaluate its risks &amp; put a mitigation plan in place, including the Collaboration Agreement.
The EPIC consortium will disseminate its progress &amp; results, &amp; intends to contribute to the SRC results’ dissemination not only with an exploitation plan but also by exercising a close coordination with all operational grants.
EPIC is coordinated by ESA &amp; complemented by renowned National Agencies: ASI, BELSPO, CDTI, CNES, DLR &amp; UKSA, &amp; by the major European space industrial associations, Eurospace &amp; SME4Space. This teaming of beneficiaries brings together the multidisciplinary mix of expertise required to deliver an unbiased, rational strategic roadmap &amp; masterplan for EP developments in H2020.</objective>
