  <objective>The VitalNodes CSA will build a lasting European network of key stakeholders based on existing European, national and regional networks. By enriching and applying a proven approach for the optimisation of economic, social and environmental vitality of urban areas from the perspective of multimodal transport infrastructure and spatial development (‘Networking for Urban Vitality’, NUVit). VitalNodes will deliver evidence-based recommendations for more (cost) efficient and sustainable integration of all 88 urban nodes in the TEN-T network corridors, addressing specifically the multi- and intermodal connection between long-distance and last-mile freight logistics. These recommendations will be validated by applying an appraisal tool and involving experts from the growing VitalNodes network.

VitalNodes will deliver three major results:
1. a self-sustaining ‘network of networks’ consisting of experts, end-users and case-owners; 
2. a proven VitalNodes approach for future cases consisting of an enriched and fine-tuned toolbox, an appraisal methodology, and a format for workshops and deployment strategy; 
3. validated recommendations on integration of urban nodes in TEN-T core network corridors.</objective>
