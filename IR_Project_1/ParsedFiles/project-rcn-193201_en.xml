  <objective>Following previous eight years of successful implementation of European Researchers' Night in Israel we will have:
o Venues covering the whole country.
o Involvement of the academic community including Israel Ministry of Science, Technology and Space (MOST), all major research universities, leading collages and three science museums.
o Awareness campaign at national level managed and funded by the Israel Ministry of Science, Technology and Space.
o Groups of junior-high and high-school students (ages 12-18) will be invited by each partner to take part in each venue.
We are ready and proud to implement European Researchers' Night 2014 &amp; 2015.

• All of the partners involved in the project have the experience of running successful European Researchers' Nights events.

• With the successive increase in number of visitors along the years and the reputation of the event we are expecting more than 50,000 visitors each year.

• Main theme for 2014 will be "Water &amp; Marine Sciences research". Main theme for 2015 will be "Brain Research" which is very attractive subject to the special 10th anniversary event.

• Same management as in 2011, 2012, 2013 successful events.

• Proposal covers both 2014 &amp; 2015 European Researchers' Night events.</objective>
