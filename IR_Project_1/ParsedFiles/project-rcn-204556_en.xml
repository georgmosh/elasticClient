  <acronym>TeraTrace</acronym>
  <objective>A near-spherical terahertz resonator will be constructed and integrated into a mobile terahertz trace gas detector. It will deliver about two orders of magnitude larger terahertz path lengths, corresponding to trace gas detection sensitivity down to one part per million. With this a means becomes available to measure trace gases that are very difficult to monitor by standard means, such as the atmospherically important hydroxyl radical.</objective>
