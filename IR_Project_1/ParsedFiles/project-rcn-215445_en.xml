  <objective>RainForest-GHG aims to quantify ecosystem sinks and emissions of three major greenhouse gases (GHGs), i.e. carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), in a tropical rainforest, and examine the contributions of the soil and the woody tissues to the ecosystem-scale GHG fluxes. RainForest-GHG further aims to determine the main environmental drivers responsible for the temporal and spatial variations of these GHG fluxes.</objective>
