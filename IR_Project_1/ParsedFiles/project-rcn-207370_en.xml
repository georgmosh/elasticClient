  <objective>The main goal of GRAPHEALTH is to exploit the inherent properties of hybrid graphene â€“ quantum dot detectors in order to enable constant non-invasive health monitoring through vital parameters. Unlike current bulky systems, our approach enables a flexible, compact and wearable health monitoring system for constant monitoring for consumer health applications and muscle health of athletes during exercise or after injury.

The hybrid quantum dot and graphene technology exhibits very high sensitivity and the technology is compatible with flexible electronic manufacturing processes, and also more compact detectors than current commercial devices.</objective>
