  <objective>Research into Enhanced Track, Switches and Structure
 
The railway of the future needs to meet the predicted growth in societal demand in terms of capacity and service, address the environmental challenges of the 21st century, and enable the political objectives of the European Union. IN2TRACK is to set the foundations for a resilient, consistent, cost-efficient, high capacity European network by delivering important building blocks that unlock the innovation potential that have been identified as part of the Shift2Rail Innovation Programme 3. Overall objectives of IN2TRACK are divided into three parts; Enhancing and optimising the switch &amp; crossings and track systems in order to ensure the optimal line usage and capacity; Investigating novel ways of extending the life of bridges and tunnel assets through new approaches to maintaining, repairing and upgrading these structures; Development and adoption of a holistic, whole system-approach. A whole-system approach ,which is defined as the system boundaries extending from dynamic wheel-rail interaction (loading input) through to degradation of the S&amp;C system, sub-systems, individual components, and underlying track foundation, will also be at the heart of IN2TRACK on how to reach the objectives. This IN2TRACK proposal addresses each of the areas identified in the H2020-S2RJU-2016-01 call. IN2TRACK is fully aligned with Shift2Rail IP3 in its objectives, approach, and ambition; addressing early enhancements and innovation opportunities.</objective>
