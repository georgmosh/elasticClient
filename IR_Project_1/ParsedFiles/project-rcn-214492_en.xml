  <objective>The proposal aims to integrate visible light photoredox catalysis with metal catalysed C-H functionalisation processes, with an emphasis on meta functionalisations under ruthenium catalysis. This dual catalysis approach will offer a  very direct approach to addressing C-H bonds that are hard to manipulate under standard conditions. By using photoredox catalysis to control the electon transfer events that govern the metal catalytic cycle, we hope to establish new reactivity under mild conditions, that can be widely exploited in chemical synthesis. 
The first part of this proposal sets out our strategy to achieve this using substrates with covalently attached directing groups. We then want to advance further and develop ways of direct C-H activation using directing groups that can be installed in situ, which is described in the second part of the proposal.</objective>
