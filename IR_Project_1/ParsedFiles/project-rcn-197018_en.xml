  <objective>Nanopore sensing has a broad range of potential applications (e.g. detection of trace amounts of substances in drug delivery/cancer diagnosis/tests for nanotoxicity and infectious diseases, next generation of DNA sequencing and protein fingerprinting) due to its outstanding sensitivity for label-free single molecule analysis. The lack of a reliable high throughput fabrication process for uniformly sized nanopores has become a serious bottleneck for research, industry and economy. With the proposed innovation project, Ionera Technologies aims to push nanopore analysis to an industrial level by developing a high throughput fabrication process for nanopores in solid-state materials. In this Phase 1 feasibility study, Ionera will combine a nano-fabrication process recently developed on a laboratory scale with its proprietary MECA technology platform to deliver the proof of technology for a parallel, industrially applicable fabrication of solid state nanopores. This will be accompanied by an assessment of the economic viability of a high throughput platform for in situ nanopore fabrication and analysis.
While so far, solid state nanopores are only available for a small group of experts in the material sciences, we put this exciting new research tool into the hands of all people who are eager to use them as a highly sensitive single molecule sensor for a wide range of applications but lack the expensive equipment and expert knowledge for standard SSN fabrication processes. Ioneraâ€™s envisioned product line will be the first one on the market that offers automatic parallel fabrication of customizable nanopores at a minimum cost.
Market for the products is the global molecular diagnostics market, with four main segments: Academic and research facilities (niche market but easily accessible for market entrance), biotechnology companies (medium volume market), contract research organizations (medium volume market) and the pharmaceutical industry (high volume market).</objective>
