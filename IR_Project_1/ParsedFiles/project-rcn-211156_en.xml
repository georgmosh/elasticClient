  <objective>Water-stress in an increasing global problem and solutions such as water recycling and seawater desalination are now becoming a necessary part of the water infrastructure. The technology for the production of safe drinking is increasingly dependent on these more diverse sources and a key enabling technology is membrane filtration. While membrane system are effective, the operating costs of such systems are hampered by fouling which increases the energy requirement for process operation. The unique idea of this Proof of Concept is to develop an electrospun nanostructured membrane which can be integrated into water filtration technologies. The unique method of fabrication will produce an inherently antibacterial and antibiofouling surface in a one-step process, cutting the number of manufacturing steps. This concept, when deployed commercially is expected to dramatically reduce the operating costs of membrane processes for water treatment. The commercialisation route of the product will be through the patent protection and the licensing of the technology with a view to rapid commercialisation.</objective>
