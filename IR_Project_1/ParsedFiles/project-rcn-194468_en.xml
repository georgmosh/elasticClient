  <objective>The National Contact Points perform valuable services in guiding and supporting national applicants in preparing proposals for Horizon 2020 funding. We expect that through an enhanced transnational cooperation and networking between National Contact Points for research infrastructures, a higher quality of their consulting services and thus of proposals and projects can be achieved. Therefore, the specific objective of RICH (Research Infrastructures COnsortium for Horizon 2020) is to facilitate trans-national co-operation between NCPs for research infrastructures with a view to identifying and sharing good practices and raising the general standard of support to programme applicants, taking into account the diversity of actors that make up the constituency of the Research Infrastructures Part.
By involving 11 formally nominated National Contact Points RICH will be able to  will extensively involve the NCPs that have decided to become “associated partner” also thanks to the setting up of a liaison office.
Concretely, activities of RICH towards this goal include, amongst others, multi-level trainings and tripling schemes, experts seminars, simposia and wide promotion of Transnational Access and Service (TAS) as well as a wide range of other communication and dissemination tools and platforms.
RICH work programme is designed to achieve an improved and professionalised NCP service across Europe, thereby helping simplify access to Horizon 2020 calls, lowering the entry barriers for newcomers, and raising the average quality of proposals submitted.</objective>
