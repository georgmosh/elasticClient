  <objective>The mission of MoGlyNet is to define a joint doctorate educational training model in Drug Discovery and Development where Academia and Industry join their forces for:
- creating a common platform of knowledge and language for early stage researchers (ESR) working in the Drug Discovery and Development area aiming to convey complementary pharma-skills
- exploiting this platform to train a new generation of cutting-edge researchers and professionals highly attractive for employment by the European Pharma-industry
- establishing structures for long-term cooperation, strengthening the relationships among the leading Universities and Pharma-enterprises and to continuously develop the research training platform that European industry relies on.
To achieve the above objectives the main tasks of MoGlyNet are:
- to attract/train 12 ESRs in optimization joint academic/industrial program of cutting-edge training-by-research, high quality supervision, complementary and transferable Pharma-skills training, inter-network secondments, and workshops/Summer Schools
- to pursue an innovative research project that will tackle a timely and important scientific problem with a multidisciplinary approach (from molecular modelling to in vivo studies). Atherosclerosis is an aging-related disease and our research approach for a better therapy of atherosclerosis will be focused on the PFKFB3 enzyme, a key player in glycolysis/oxidative stress and therefore in pathological angiogenesis 
- to build a solid foundation for long-term European excellence in this field by disseminating MoGlyNet research/training outcomes and best practice into the partners Doctoral Schools, and by fostering long-term partnerships and collaborations that will outlast the Consortium
- to transfer expertise/know-how among the Consortium participants and to external groups via networking activities, intersectorial exposure, secondments, workshops, sharing of learning material, public engagement and outreach activities</objective>
