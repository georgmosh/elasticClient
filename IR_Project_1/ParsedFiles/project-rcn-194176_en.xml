  <acronym>INTELUM</acronym>
  <objective>Currently, new concepts are being considered for hadron and jet calorimetry in high energy physics experiments, in order to improve the energy resolution of these detectors by a factor of at least two. This is a prerequisite for future studies at the high luminosity, large hadron collider as well as at future electron and proton colliders. Amongst the few concepts being proposed, scintillating and Čerenkov fibres are considered very promising candidates.

The INTELUM project will be a 4 year project funding international, industry-academia exchanges to develop micro-pulling-down crystal growth and other new types of fibre technology. This new fibre production technology has the potential to enable fast, low-cost, manufacture of heavy crystal scintillating fibres.

In order to prove the new fibre technology concept, two key technical issues will be addressed during the project:

• demonstrate feasibility of producing between 20-200km of fibres with consistent quality and well defined production costs
• demonstrate sufficient radiation hardness of the fibres that the degradation of their optical properties is below 10% at 1 MGy level

This ambitious project will be undertaken by a truly international consortium of sixteen institutes and companies, many closely linked to the Crystal Clear Collaboration. The project will also lead to important impacts in other domains such as functional medical imaging and homeland security.</objective>
