  <objective>Ten years ago, our innovative Israeli SME company, Aqua Solutions Ltd. was founded. Since the beginning, our CEO, Mr. Ahmed Alimi, focused all our efforts on the optimisation of laundering processes by means of cleaning and disinfecting solutions without the usage of detergent. This led us to develop a process that has a strong cleaning ability and a strong disinfecting ability consuming only three elements: electricity, water and salt.
With AquaPure our aim is to develop a detergent free process for industrial and household dishwashers. This apparatus will be integrated in the dishwashers and will be capable of reducing the energy consumption per cycle (70%), reduce water consumption (50%), and decrease each washing cycle duration (20%). The innovative technology helps significantly reduce costs per cycle (Energy: household: 200kWh/year; industrial: 330-2830kWh/year; water used: household: 780L/cycle; industrial: 1.200-75.200-40L/year ) and dramatically reduce environmental impact.</objective>
