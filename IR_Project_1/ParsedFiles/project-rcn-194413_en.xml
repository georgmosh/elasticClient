  <objective>ENATRANSâ€™ main objective is to network and support SMEs in translation of nanomedicine in Europe by providing a one-stop-shop service to interact and share information, experience and advice with up-to-date information and interactive tools, but also enabling personal contacts.
To be successful SMEs need to understand the requirements of the complex ecosystem made up of regulatory and reimbursement agencies, as well as the requirements of large industrial companies and clinical needs. ENATRANS will gather and provide information about approval processes, regulatory authorities and agencies, clinical and market data, and specific nanomedicine value chain analysis, relevant SME support projects and organisations. ENATRANS will convert this critical information in dedicated learning programs and tools dedicated to translation of nanomedicine.  
ENATRANS aims at implementing the concept of a Translation Advisory Board (TAB) as central element of the ETPN White Paper. A TAB will be set-up with senior experienced translation experts to guide R&amp;D teams (in SMEs and research institutes) along the translation process to successfully make it to clinical trials and later to the market.
Promising projects identified and supported by the TAB need access to clinical centers for first studies in patients, which are able to handle the specificity of new nanotechnology based therapeutics. In addition, financial resources are needed to go pass the regulatory and scale-up processes, which often require funding from investors and/or large companies. ENATRANS will build bridges to clinical trial centers, investors and large companies.
Promising projects need guidance to successfully master privileged contacts with the medical, the business or the investment community. ENATRANS will deliver special coaching sessions prior to showcasing of promising projects.
Partners in ENATRANS are VDI/VDE-IT, Nanobiotix, CEA, bioanalytik-muenster, Tel Aviv University, Fondazione Don Gnocchi, TecMinho.</objective>
