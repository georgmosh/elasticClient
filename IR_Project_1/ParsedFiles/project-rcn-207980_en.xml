  <acronym>B-On-Chip</acronym>
  <objective>BEOnChip S.L. is a leading Spanish company focused on the field of Micro-biotechnology. 
We have fully engineered microchips that recapitulate the microarchitecture and functions of living human organs. These microchips, called “organs-on-chips”, can be defined as micro-sized artificial organs and can revolutionize drug development. Now, in the B-On-Chip project we seek bringing to the market the first compact, fully automated and easy-to-use device to link multiple organs-on-chip, enabling the so called body-on-chip experiments. The use of B-On-Chip by the Pharma industry in new drug discovery, has the potential to slash the use of laboratory animals in drug testing. Furthermore, the more realistic data offered by B-On-Chip will accelerate drug development and allow researchers to carry out experiments too risky for human volunteers. Moreover, by linking different “organ-on-chips” together, it will be possible to study how reactions in one organ affect another. B-On-Chip will offer the most accurate data on new drug efficiency, security, toxicity in a fast, automatic and reliable way, with the breakthrough advantage of being able to offer these results in in vitro experiments.</objective>
