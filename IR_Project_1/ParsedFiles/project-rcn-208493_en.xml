  <objective>The DNA damage response (DDR) is a set of cellular events that follow the generation of a DNA damage. We have previously discovered a novel class of small non-coding RNAs, named DNA damage RNAs (DDRNAs), which are necessary for the full DDR activation upon a DNA double-strand break generation. Our preliminary data show that also at damaged/dysfunctional telomeres telomeric transcrips are produced. By using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting them, we aim at modulating DDR in cultured cells and in vivo in animal models.</objective>
