  <acronym>LEAP home</acronym>
  <objective>The aim of our project is to fully meet the new demands for energy sustainability and reduced environmental impact throughout a building's entire lifecycle as well as the emerging trends for a lifestyle more deeply steeped in nature. 
This will be achieved by supplying truly high-performance buildings. The offer will consist of kits: individual, customizable, pre-wired and furnished homes, that even including auxiliary internal outfitting. Innovative materials and production technologies, advanced building engineering processes for components and production using numerical control systems, will allow to obtain extremely high dimensional precision, thus making dry assembly of all components possible with a reduced use of polluting materials like mortars and  glues. 
Thanks to the the use of composite materials and of specific construction technologies, the weight of the building components will be limited and thus shipping, even over long distances, will be cheaper.</objective>
