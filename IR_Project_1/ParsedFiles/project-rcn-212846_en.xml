  <objective>The DecoChrom project elevates printed graphics products to the age of interactivity, and
empowers the creative industries with the tools and innovative advanced material sets to design
and build aesthetically pleasing practical human interfaces to smart consumer goods and
environments. The DecoChrom consortium develops printed electrochromics (EC) as the mass
producible, print industry compatible, ultra low-power interactive graphics solution for ambient
intelligence.
DecoChrom will scale-up the production of advanced composite materials into 3 innovative ink EC
colours, manufacturing process on different materials (plastic foil, paper, high-pressure laminates
and 3D durable plastic parts), wide dissemination and creation of EC toolkits to introduce
electrochromics to designers, makers and the printing industry, and finally the co-creation of more
than 20 creative industry lead end-user prototypes and pilots for architecture, interior design, lifestyle
and sports.

The project brings together a strong interdisciplinary consortium of 15 partners, industry and
research balanced, with state-of-the-art backgrounds in design, chemistry, printing, coatings and
laminates, electronics system integration, and complete electrochromics solutions. This is
complemented with the commitment of a multidisciplinary Industrial Advisory Board with
representation of key industry end-users such as Ikea (furniture), Lego (toys), BMW (automotive),
Fiskars (domestic tools), Hoffmann + Krippner (printed electronics, industrial printing) and GSB
Wahl (ink production).</objective>
