  <objective>Proton beam therapy (PBT) is a radical new type of advanced radiotherapy, capable of delivering and conforming a targeted dose of radiation to the tumour while causing minimal damage to the surrounding healthy tissue. In the past 5 years there has been a huge investment in high energy PBT across Europe and eleven member states now either have PBT in operation or are developing this capability.  In addition, the two largest manufactures of PBT equipment have based their manufacturing in Europe. This integrating activity INSPIRE, aims to link these clinical PBT centres in eleven different countries together with two associated centres in USA.  It also brings in two of the worlds largest manufacturers of PBT equipment and an SME.  The trans-national access in INSPIRE will provide European researchers with access to “state of the art” research capabilities employing proton beams at clinical energies.  INSPIRE represents an integrating activity across Europe in a multi-disciplinary field that is growing exponentially. 
Through its Networking, Transnational Access and Joint Research Activities,  INSPIRE seeks to provide the “state of the art” capabilities that are needed to address the key challenges in this rapidly developing field. INSPIRE has at its heart the principles of responsible research and innovation and will communicate its research and give access to its databases and software through an Open Access Gateway.  INSPIRE will contain a pipeline of innovation through its Innovation Gateway, to accelerate research for patient and commercial benefit.  INSPIRE will provide its researchers with an unrivalled research and training and opportunities to “discipline hop” into the industrial, clinical or industrial environment.  INSPIRE integrates activities across Europe in this rapidly growing area and offers European researchers unrivalled access to state of the art research capabilities in an area where there has already been significant government investment.</objective>
