  <objective>To discover effective strategies against antimicrobial resistance, a deeper understanding of microbial behaviour in their natural ecologies is crucial. The essential technological bottleneck that has limited our capability to explore this issue is the microenvironment provided by batch culture assays. They are incapable of mimicking natural microhabitats, quantifying individual bacteria, and revealing antibiotic resistance. Therefore, development of a theoretical and experimental framework that mimics the natural microecology of bacteria and measuring their antibiotic response to predict optimum survival strategies will provide valuable tools to investigate bacterial individuality and their changing response to antibiotics in realistic microenvironments.</objective>
