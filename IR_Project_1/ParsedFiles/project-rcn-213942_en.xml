  <acronym>FLAPSENSE</acronym>
  <objective>The main objective of the proposed project FLAPSENSE is to design and manufacture a contactless measurement system for real time monitoring of proprotor flapping angle. The system will be integrated in the proprotor assembly and co-rotates with the rotor. It will be based on an highly accurate optical sensing method providing the actual flap motion of the rotor blade to the avionic system. The Partners DLR, Hit09 and NLR will closely cooperate in order to design, test and manufacture this sensor during the project duration. Besides several laboratory testing at DLR and a test on a rotary test bench at NLR, finally the sensor will be ground and flight tested on the NextGenCTR Demonstrator.</objective>
