  <acronym>FRAMING_EFFECTS</acronym>
  <objective>Fellowship objective is to explain influences of descriptive context on individual decisions, i.e. framing effects, by observing processes of making-sense (of representation/interpretation/rationalization). Experimental Economics ignores effects of framing on this “black-box” of decision-making processes, and instead theorizes framing by observing only choices &amp; using fixed preference structures. This not only limits our understanding of these effects but weakens real-world applicability of experimental results &amp; leads to inefficient use of public funds; e.g., it is well-established that descriptions used in policy tools, e.g. contingent valuation (CV) &amp; nudging, significantly affect results, yet it is unknown why or how. To unpack this box, fellowship at U. of Nottingham’s Centre for Decision Research &amp; Experimental Economics (CeDEx) will combine Dr.Isler’s background in methodology research with training/research on framing to develop 2 new experiment designs. Secondment at Leeds U. Centre for Decision Research will enable training on Process Tracing Methods (PTMs) &amp; Mouselab software to provide capacity for process observations. Using PTMs/Mouselab in experiments at CeDEx, 1st design will isolate framing effects that choice/preference-based conventional theories cannot explain; 2nd design will analyse these effects in CV-like public good setting to develop probabilistic/structural model to forecast &amp; PTM-based nonconventional theory to explain the effects. To allow sector/policy applications of lab results (e.g., to CV), designs will be used in field experiments at health/fundraising SME secondments, where training on patient/donor interaction &amp; gender/ethics issues will prepare proper implementation. Fellowship’s training-through-research will thus launch a career in PTM-based framing research leading to innovations in Horizon 2020 health/efficiency/gender priorities that save public/private funds via appropriate reframing of customer relations &amp; policy tools.</objective>
