  <objective>In this project we aim to demonstrate and test a MEMS-based miniaturized electronic x-ray source enabled through a vacuum packaging concept developed under an ERC AdG. The source should be capable of delivering doses up to approximately 1 Gy/min at a 2 mm distance while still having a millimetre overall size. This will be achieved by combining the vacuum packaging technique with a pointed field emission array developed in another project. The goal of the project is to demonstrate key functionalities and take the technology to TRL 4 with the ambition establish collaboration with leading company in brachytherapy.</objective>
