  <acronym>Q-Sense</acronym>
  <objective>Q-SENSE will promote international and inter-sector collaboration for the advancement of science and the development of innovation in the area of cold atom quantum sensors. In particular it fosters a shared culture of research and innovation that turns the Nobel-prize winning ideas of cold atom research and precision measurement (Nobel prizes 1997 and 2005) into innovative products. In particular, we bring together a synergetic network of the world leaders in optical clocks and atom interferometers with technology translators and end user applicants to promote space and terrestrial applications of optical clocks and cold atom gravity sensors with an additional eye on implications on policies via the JRC. Our research and innovation programme will deliver knowledge exchange around a technology demonstrator for a space optical clock, development plans for atom interferometer satellite missions, an open source toolbox for simulations of atom interferometer performance in real-world applications and outreach to over 70 companies and the public raising awareness of the potential of optical clocks and cold atom gravimeters for economic and societal benefits, such as in global water monitoring, humanitarian de-mining, satellite navigation and broadband communication. Q-SENSE will enhance the skills of research- and innovation-related human resources in our partner organisations to work seamlessly across sectors and provide new career perspectives in the emerging area of commercial quantum technologies.</objective>
