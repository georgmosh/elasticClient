  <objective>The STYLUS project aims to introduce into the global market the first open-roof 100% electric Double Decker Bus (eDDB). Furthermore, through implementing advanced new technologies, CARROCERIAS AYATS (from now on AYATS) will come up with a DDB with larger capacity (76 seats + 1PRM seat) and high autonomy (140km) offering a more efficient solution that will obviously be able to target not only the tourist sector but all urban road transport. 

The difficulty of electrifying a Double Decker Bus is high compared to a small vehicle and even to a Single Decker Bus. The development of the STYLUS first prototype has supposed a challenge for CARROCERIAS AYATS, due to difficulties that has found the company on introducing the huge batteries in the most reduced space, in order to acheive a maximum capacity for passengers.</objective>
