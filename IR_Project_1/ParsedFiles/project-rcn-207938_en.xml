  <objective>CAR-E, Creative Automotive Reuse E-commerce, is an exchange platform between automobile wrecking yards and final users (mechanics and private clients) that at the same time optimizes the reuse of car parts and discourages their underground, elicit trade. It allows tracing the whole process of buying and selling used car parts, guaranteeing a valid alternative to the use of non-original car parts and making it easier to intercept fake parts.</objective>
