  <objective>Antibiotic resistance is rife (fig. 1), yet notoriously difficult to predict. Here I propose to assess the applied potential of an easy to use device, ‘EVOLchip’  that allows to test antibiotic treatment schemes within a few weeks for their risk of inducing antimicrobial resistance.  If successful, this would allow to use current antibiotics much longer and to reuse old antibiotics in combination. Such tests can be conducted at hospital level by any trained medical microbiologist and hence be implemented into routine antibiotic stewardship. 
The proposed project entails (a) a praxis test with an enduser, a large university hospital, (b) an IPstrategy (c) a market and competitor analysis (d) a finance plan (e) a strategy to engage industrial partners and end-users.</objective>
