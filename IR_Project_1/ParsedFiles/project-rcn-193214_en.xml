  <objective>Bristol’s proposal for the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Researchers’ Night programme takes part across 2014 and 2015. Bristol’s programme for Researchers’ Night has an ambition to involve a wide cross-section of researchers across the city’s two universities centred on the theme ‘Bristol Bright Night’ highlighting the innovative research undertaken by Bristol-based researchers addressing local and global societal challenges. During the Researchers’ Night the city’s waterfront will be transformed into an Innovation Laboratory giving everyone equal access to ground-breaking research, in particular young and family audiences.  Bristol has the advantage of having several world-renowned public venues within a short walk of each other in its historical centre. These will host the Researchers’ Night 2014 and 2015. Additionally, in 2015 special opportunities will be provided for celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Researchers’ Night, and the programme will also benefit from Bristol’s designation as European Green Capital in 2015. Bristol’s programme for Researchers’ Night will focus on environmental science and sustainability research conducted locally and through European projects, particularly by Marie Skłodowska-Curie (MSC) fellows, however, Bristol’s digital and creative media cluster will also be involved.</objective>
