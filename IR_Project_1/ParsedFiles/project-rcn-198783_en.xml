  <objective>The ERA-NET NEURON Cofund will coordinate and align European and international research funding programmes in the area of brain-related diseases and disorders of the nervous system. Key activity is the implementation of an EC co-funded joint transnational call for research proposals. The mission of NEURON is based on the fact that disorders of the brain are the major cause for impaired quality of life, and they are a heavy burden not only for patients, their families and carers, but also a socioeconomic problem for society. By improving collaboration and by implementing a variety of additional activities (such as further joint transnational calls and support of early-career scientists) NEURON Cofund will decrease fragmentation of research programmes and improve the funding situation for neuroscience researchers thereby strengthening the search for novel therapeutic approaches to fight brain disease. 
NEURON Cofund will also develop and provide concrete plans for (i) expanding data sharing, (ii) promoting common data elements for the establishment of patient registries, and (iii) involving stakeholders and relevant existing initiatives such as patient organizations. The aforementioned challenges will be addressed in a network of 22 funding organizations across 14 European Member and Associated States and Third countries.</objective>
