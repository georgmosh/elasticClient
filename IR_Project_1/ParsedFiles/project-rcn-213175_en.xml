  <objective>Scale-EUp2 (ecoSystems Connected to AcceLerate and Encourage European Union start-uPs Potential) is a market driven action which ambitions to identify a portfolio of a minimum 200 high potential start-ups through the 4 connected hubs and to help them scale-up and to become leaders in the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications markets. 

The 4 Ecosystems will join their efforts to scout-out for the high potential start-ups in need of resources, the hubs regional markets making it like a European spider-web. The ecosystemsâ€™ scouting will extend to the overall European IoT markets by exploiting value chain analyses and the mobilization of European market stakeholders from the hubs and beyond. The partners from the hubs will also provide support, once the different facets of scouting has been completed, to organize match-making, to help the selected start-ups to join innovation projects and thus establish partnerships, alliances allowing to reinforce the valuation of the start-ups. At the same time, the partners will develop and set up tools for the start-ups to gain access more easily to financing as well as to the human resources market.</objective>
