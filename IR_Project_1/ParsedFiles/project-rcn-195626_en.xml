  <objective>My project titled 'Thessaly under the Kings: Religion, Society and the Politics of Multiculturalism in Mainland Greeceâ€™ examines the reorganization of sacred space, the cult practices and the religious beliefs attested in Thessaly from the mid-fourth century to the second century BC. The evidence will be discussed in terms of continuity and change, from the gradual modification of the Thessalian geopolitical and urban landscapes, which was exercised by the Macedonian rulers, to the annexation of the region into the Hellenistic Kingdom of Macedonia, down, finally, to the decline of the Macedonian power and the emergence of Roman control in the region.</objective>
