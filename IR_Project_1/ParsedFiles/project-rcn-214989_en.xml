  <acronym>TOMATO EXODERMIS</acronym>
  <objective>Understanding plant development and responses to the environment is key for improving crop yields and ensuring food and fuel for the future. Many crop species have evolved adaptations that make them more tolerant against abiotic stresses, such as drought, flooding and soil salinity. One of these adaptations is the exodermis, a water- and air-proofed cell layer in the root that protects the root from drying and drowning. Although the importance of exodermis for crop yield has been shown, the development of exodermis is not understood on molecular level, likely due to its absence from the root model species
Arabidopsis. TOMATO EXODERMIS aims to elucidate the genes involved in exodermal development and drought responses in tomato. To achieve this, novel tools are combined in an efficient way to study root development of a crop species in a short timeframe. These tools include e.g. bioinformatic analyses of new cell type-specific datasets, rapid hairy root cultures and genome editing. TOMATO EXODERMIS will lay a foundation for an exodermis research program in European Research Area and generate potential for agricultural applications.</objective>
