  <objective>Recently, researchers have developed a new framework for decomposing the information that is shared by a number of variables, which characterizes public information that is shared by all the variables and private information that is contained only in specific elements. The main contribution of this work has been to distinguish between redundant and synergistic interdependencies: the former corresponds to variables that share the same information, while the latter refers to information sharing modes where the statistical dependency exists within the whole but not between the parts. 

The objective of this project is to analyze the relevance of synergistic modes of information sharing in different contexts, developing a deeper understanding of their nature and consequences. For this, the project has as specific goals (a) to further develop the theoretical framework for studying synergistic information sharing structures, and to use this framework to bring new light in important applications: (b) biometric databases and privacy due to its relevance for our modern society and (c) the study of brain activity due to its fascinating structure and function.</objective>
