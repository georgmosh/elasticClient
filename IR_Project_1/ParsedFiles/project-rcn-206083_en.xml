  <objective>Industrial Phycology (IPHYC) has developed a wastewater treatment (WWT) process to meet tightening discharge consents for the concentration of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and other materials in wastewater (WW) effluents. These nutrients &amp; materials are linked to adverse environmental events e.g. eutrophication. WWT operators require a sustainable treatment process to remove / recover these materials to meet legislation.

IPHYC's novel patented WWT process uses microalgae (MA) to remove nutrients from WW) effluents. MA reproduce rapidly when sufficient nutrients, light &amp; C02 are supplied. The MA consume nutrients in the WW until depleted cleaning the effluent to the legislated discharge consent concentrations, allowing the operator to meet its statutory commitments &amp; not risk financial penalties. The biomass is retained for reactor seeding or harvested for valorisation e.g. use for anaerobic digestion, animal feed, feedstock for bio-based industries.

The process has been validated by I-PHYC in a recent field trial at Wessex Waterâ€™s Avonmouth WWT plant &amp; a supporting feasibility study carried out though SME instrument phase 1 support. Through the phase 1 project, IPHYC engaged with the UK water industry to understand the market &amp; end-user needs. From this IPHYC has worked with industry partners to identify the work required to prove its technology &amp; develop its process to commercial readiness. IPHYC is applying for funding to enable it to achieve this by; building a commercial demonstrator of its process for the treatment of municipal wastewaters; optimising its process for the treatment of industrial effluents (e.g. mines); develop methods of recovering value from the algal biomass; further engage with key industry companies, decision makers and potential future customers; develop its commercial strategy for the delivering the technology to market. This outcomes of the project will enable IPHYC to enter the market with a credible and proven disruptive technology.</objective>
