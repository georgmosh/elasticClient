  <objective>The main objective of this project is to establish open and informed dialogues, co-created by European citizens, the civil society, bioeconomy innovation networks, local research centers, business and industry stakeholders and various levels of government including the European Commission. BLOOM will elaborate five hubs (communities of practice) that will allow for an iterative process that involves with all stakeholders through various cycles of value development, enabling cross-fertilization and idea generation through shared knowledge and experiences. In co-created workshops outreach activities will be designed, explored and validated that are exactly adapted to the regional needs of the stakeholders. 
The interactions aim to 
(a) raise awareness and knowledge on bioeconomy by enabling open and informed dialogue throughout the bioeconomy innovation processes (b) build up and strengthen a bioeconomy community, (c) gain a common understanding of the concept, providing reliable insights into bioeconomies, its practices, benefits and implications (d) foster learning and education. With that, the project will support the reduction of existing barriers towards a bioeconomy and stimulate bioeconomy activities at the regional and EU level.</objective>
