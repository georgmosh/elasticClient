  <acronym>KATEDRAL</acronym>
  <objective>TreaTech, a young clean-tech Swiss company, has developed an innovative technology that will revolutionise the waste management of sewage sludge by turning it into valuable by-products and energy such as biogas, clean water and natural fertilizers that would otherwise be lost during disposal process. 
Contrary to other solutions that rely on incineration or landfilling, which are expensive for companies and harmful for the environment, TreaTech has developed a treatment unit KATEDRAL that can operate with the vast majority of liquid waste streams, and contribute to provide a cost-efficient, ecological and reliable disposal solution. Our mobile  unit KATEDRAL will offer a solution 40% cheaper than incineration since it does not require transport of the material nor fossil energy for incineration and will reduce more than 60% of todayâ€™s GHG emissions since organic compounds present in the sludge are not burnt anymore, but transformed into valuable renewable energy (biogas).</objective>
