  <objective>The OPEN3GEN project will access an entirely new phase space to discover long-lived particles at the Large Hadron Collider.  Current data-recording algorithms (“triggers”) do not record directly this type of event at the LHC.  My team and I will maximise the experimental sensitivity by developing trigger strategies and reconstruction methods to yield the first datasets that will be sensitive to long-lived particles decaying to third generation particles. This will result, for the first time, in limits on, or observations of, long-lived particles in new lifetime regimes and signatures. In the case of a discovery, a program is proposed to measure the underlying dynamics of the New Physics by accessing information on the mass scale, lifetimes and spin information of the new particles. This proposal evidences my qualities as a creative PI applying specialised abilities to seek out orthogonal, novel activities to push back the boundaries of science.</objective>
