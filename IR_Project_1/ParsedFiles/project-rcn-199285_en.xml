  <objective>The overall objective of NANOHIGH is the deployment in the market of an innovative technology for the production of high accuracy fibered/spherical-shaped nanocapsules based on principles of ElectroHydroDynamics (EHD). This technology, known as Coaxial EHD, enables the cost-effective manufacture of high accuracy capsules with special configurations and functionalities, which can be used for the controlled delivery of active compounds in multiple applications. The performance of this patent protected technology has been demonstrated in a lab scale pilot; however, its derivative products have not fully entered the market due to the lack of industrial scale equipment, required for the market deployment.</objective>
