  <objective>"The objective of the EBSF_2 project is to validate different innovative solutions that combine efficiency of the bus system with more attractiveness. 
Such solutions are meant to represent the most innovative in the areas indicated by the Call: the project will proceed to their final validation before their introduction in the market, avoiding pure simulations or large use of prototypes. 
Following the System Approach, and with the participation of representatives of all key stakeholders categories, these activities will be introduced by the identification of innovation requirements (that will drive the impact assessment), the update of the Bus System Definition (as defined in EBSF). 
In addition to the impact analysis of the single solutions, the effect of combining key introduction will be evaluated. 
The "European Bus System of the Future" Roadmap will be updated with areas for further research and priorities linked to the project topics.</objective>
