  <objective>The dynamics of exotic systems such as high-temperature superconductors and heavy fermion materials is gaining ever increasing interest as it contains important clues to the mechanism driving the often unanticipated and technologically very relevant properties. Shot noise spectroscopy is a very powerful technique to study the dynamics of electronic correlations in such quantum electron systems, but to date has been limited to mesoscopic systems. We propose to set up, test and use an experimental probe that can perform shot noise measurements on the atomic scale, thereby gaining access to crucial information on the scale where all the action occurs: the atoms, the electrons, and – in combination with spin resolved tunneling spectroscopy – the spins. We will achieve this by developing a low temperature, high frequency compatible scanning tunneling microscope. This project will combine expertise on shot noise spectroscopy at CNRS in Paris and low temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy expertise of the experienced researcher, and will bring important new insights into the time domain properties of correlated electron systems.</objective>
