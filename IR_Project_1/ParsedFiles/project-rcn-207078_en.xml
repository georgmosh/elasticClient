  <objective>The aim of the project is to develop a novel low-cost intelligent crystallization visualization tool that enables the collection of real-time stereo (or combined visible and infrared) images as well as prevents probe fouling by using a specially designed anti-fouling control system. With the additional software interface, with efficient image analysis approaches incorporated in the crystallization process informatics systems, the tool will be the first low-cost, real-time and in situ intelligent imaging tool, with built in crystallization control and design capabilities. With the specially designed anti-fouling system the probe will prevent encrust formation on the probe window, which is a typical problem for all imaging tools currently available on the market. Besides being an efficient and robust monitoring tool, the system will also enable users to readily apply state-of-the-art crystallization design and control approaches developed as part of the ERC CrySys: Crystallisation Systems Engineering â€“ Towards a Next Generation of Intelligent Crystallisation Systems project, for the rapid design of crystallization processes, broadening the potential impact of the control technologies developed in the research.</objective>
