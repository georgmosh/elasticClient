  <objective>Management and maintenance of pipe systems present a major problem: leaks. The existence of leaks is costly, both economic and environmental terms, especially when considering finite resources. The ISPNET project proposes a new smart pipe system for early detection of leaks and preventive maintenance of networks, including a last generation of transmission system specifically tested for water distribution, but with further application in other fluids’ transportation networks (oil &amp; gas, industrial liquids…). The new system, which has been installed and subject to public trials, will optimize the properties of existing piping systems and in turn, serve as reporter element of all incidents occurring in the pipe system and as management tool of parameters commonly used. The solution offer innovative advantages both in terms of the materials used for the pipe and due to the monitoring and traceability possibilities of the embedded sensor system. There is no other similar system in the market, and the cost per meter of the system is lower than “conventional” ones. SME INSTRUMENT Phase 1 will help to define requirements to validate the product in different configurations (dimensions, monitoring functionalities) and uses (drinking water and other fluids), as well as to automate the production process. Through a feasibility study, ABN will measure the potential of the solution in terms of efficiency, business opportunity and compliance with standards, analyze the commercial impact of the device and define the market in concrete and realistic terms, in order to attract investors. All this will reduce time to market for a very promising solution, which has received expression of interest of major water distrubution companies. It has also been recently (April 2015) awarded at first Ideas Competition (Sustainability award) launched by the Spanish network of Smart and Innovative Cities RED INNPULSO.</objective>
