  <objective>The concept is to create a family of novel, lightweight EVs, through an EU based organisation co-ordinating design, manufacture, supply and support service infrastructure, targeted at producing zero emission city mobility for co-ordinated hire schemes, transportation networks, taxi or private individual transport.

EC policy  demands sustainable urban mobility, specifically within the growing carshare and city hire market. Nedra has been formed specifically to capitalise on these emerging opportunities through an Electric Vehicle (EV) platform where Product Specification and New Product Development processes are optimised to match exactly the market needs and the mantra “just enough” is applied. The Nedra product range features a combination of lightweight, low cost, longer range and rapid charge platform that is not currently met by any single existing product. This will be key to realising the company’s growth strategy of sales turnover of €36milion p.a. by 2020.  In addition to the product range we have identified that, we can create an EU-based network which co-ordinates manufacture, supply and service for this family of EVs worldwide. 

The purpose of this feasibility study is to confirm some of the assumptions regarding the market, identify further key suppliers and partners, and establish the product legislative and compliance needs.</objective>
