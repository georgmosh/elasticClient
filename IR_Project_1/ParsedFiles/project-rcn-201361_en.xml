  <objective>The ARCADIA project will focus on building artificial photosynthetic devices (or photoelectrochemical cells), with the aim of producing alternative fuels exploiting renewable energy sources (namely sunlight). The key strategy will involve the development of photoelectrodes able to perform the water oxidation (at the anode) and the carbon dioxide reduction (at the cathode), and their further assembly in a standalone set-up (i.e. requiring no other energy source, but sunlight). Thus, ARCADIA will contribute to the abatement of the atmospheric anthropogenic emissions of the greenhouse gas CO2 by its exploitation as a renewable carbon feedstock to obtain clean fuels and value-added chemicals as the target products.</objective>
