  <objective>THING will advance the perceptual capabilities of highly mobile legged platforms through haptic perception and active exploration. In this light, THING will deliver: 1) Novel foot designs for enhanced tactile perception and locomotion, 2) Improved perceptual capability, enriching existing modalities (lidar, vision) with haptic information, 3) Heightened physical sense of the environment, including friction, ground stability (difficult through vision alone), and 4) Enhanced mobility through improved perception, prediction, and control.</objective>
