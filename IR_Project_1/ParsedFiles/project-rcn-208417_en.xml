  <objective>Slovenia was identified as a region lagging in innovation within the Horizon2020 WIDESPREAD 2014-1: Teaming call for proposals, and this is is particularly noticeable in the country's forest-based value chain. However, the vital core of Sloveniaâ€™s renewable resource-based value chain has retained access to international markets and a significant production capacity in spite of an overall workforce reduction. Therefore this industry exhibits a strong potential for growth, which was identified in the Smart Specialization Strategy of Slovenia. The Smart Specialization Strategy of Slovenia calls for inter-sectoral networking and integration of the wood chain in the design of homes and working environments of the future. It promotes research and innovation deriving from traditional knowledge and skills related to wood and wood-compatible natural materials and seeks to increase added value and export of companies by 15% by 2023. In order to leverage this potential by facilitating collaborations between industry and academia in this sector, the Renewable materials and healthy environments research and innovation Centre of Excellence (InnoRenew CoE) was established. With support and guidance from the advanced partner, Fraunhofer WKI, scientific research and development activities will be transferred rapidly and effectively to the industry and through them to society in the form of innovative new products and processes.</objective>
