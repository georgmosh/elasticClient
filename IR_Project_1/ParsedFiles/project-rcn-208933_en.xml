  <objective>A new framework is introduced for control and estimation of traffic flow in freeways and arterials. In the new methodology,
feedforward and feedback control designs are developed, based on continuum in time and space traffic-flow models, which
assign to the traffic flow the desired shape, with an a priori prescribed convergence rate and for any initial traffic profile. The
novel control and estimation algorithms require minimum amount of information since they utilize measurements at the
entries and exits of the freeway and arterial links. The designs are accompanied with tools for verification that are
introduced, which provide quantified actual performance guarantees and robustness margins of the proposed algorithms.
The methodology is validated in simulation, using fictitious and real data of traffic, and/or in a real traffic system.</objective>
