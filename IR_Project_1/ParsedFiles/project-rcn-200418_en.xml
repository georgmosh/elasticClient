Parents experience confirmed by our and specialist’s research shows that brushing teeth is an activity that many children find not useful and boring, but what is the most important – they do not understand the future consequences of not brushing or brushing with the wrong technique. According to specialists, because of this over 30% of kids aged 4-10 suffer from tooth decay in countries like UK, Germany, France, the USA or similar developed countries, even up to 70-80% in countries like Poland. Worldwide, 60–90% of school children and nearly 100% of adults suffer from dental cavities (WHO, 2014). Specialists recommends that the most important is to focus on the frequency and the duration of brushing, as this is the key aspect of children dental problems. We found solution to help them using modern technologies.
The solution for parents that are challenged to make children brush their teeth regularly is FunBrush. FunBrush provides a smart toy to change brushing into what children love the most - games.
