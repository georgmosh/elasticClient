  <objective>How to provide justice for conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) has now become a highly visible and challenging global problem with few solutions. The TRANSFORM project addresses this problem by creating a prototype Gender Justice Framework to guide analysis of, and responses to, conflict-related sexual violence. The ERC Gender of Justice Project (GoJ) provides a unique array of justice indicators and innovative methods that can deliver ground-breaking strategies to combat impunity for conflict-related sexual violence. The prototype Framework exploits these cutting edge analytics and insights by building them into an integrated package of guiding principles and tools for policy-makers and practitioners. These ‘how to’ guides and instruments map patterns of sexual violence and affected groups, assess the adequacy of criminal and social justice responses, and generate new justice strategies. This prototype framework for analysis and action in this difficult field has wide application for those working in the human rights, international criminal law, transitional justice, and peace building and security sectors in conflict-affected contexts.</objective>
