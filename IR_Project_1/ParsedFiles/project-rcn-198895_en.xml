  <objective>Chronic patients suffering from mood disorder and depression comorbid to other pathologies or drug treatments receive poor preventive screening, insufficient early diagnosis and follow-up; the insurgence of depression with one more pathological condition amplifies the loss of Quality-Adjusted Life Expectancy expected for both depression and the other condition. Lucy is a cross-platform cloud environment continuously collecting biomarkers belonging to psychic and relational life of the person, like anxiety, depression, pain, disability, relational impairment, using screening tools officially validated by medical practice. An advanced relational system, characterized by very low cost for the patient, elaborates information and translates it into objective and communicable data available to the team of attending physicians, providing continuous, updated patient monitoring, through data-mining and smart on the go doctor interface.</objective>
