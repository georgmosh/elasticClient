  <acronym>TFence</acronym>
  <objective>Terafence is developing a state-of-the-art Firmware/microchip, “TFence™”, patents pending, for cyber-secured connectivity,
and mechanical waves to control medical implants. This advanced Firmware/chip ensures total protection from tampering by
enabling data outflow while completely blocking data entry and with it malicious attacks.
· The “TFence™” is designed to meet the IoT cyber security market requirements. Data outflow while completely blocking
data entry and malicious attacks
· One-way communication by means of small &amp; cheap hardware Converting multi protocols from the secured network to
multi protocols for the unsecured network
· Supporting numerous sensors at the secured network and analyzing initial real time profiling/statistics
· IoT/sensors profiling to protect from botnet activities</objective>
  <title>A patent pending solution/microchip for the IoT cybersecurity market requirements: no access toonline software updates, very small size, inexpensive hardware, low energy consumption.</title>
