  <objective>SEPPELEC, S.L. is an engineering company, we are specialists in process engineering for drink factories and facilities. The ultimate goal we seek in ASEPTIC-VACBID project is to develop an automatic and aseptic equipment to empty concentrated juices out of aseptic bags. We have already developed a semi-automatic prototype achieving aseptic conditions to empty bags up to 25L. The objective of this project is to scale-up the aseptic system in a complete automatic equipment to empty the standard 250L and 1,500L bags used in the juice industry. By incorporating an ASEPTIC-VACBID system into the production process, capable to empty 18,000L of concentrate per hour, the juice industry will reduce energy consumption costs of â‚¬150,000 per year (1.324.422 kW), representing an improvement of 13% in the energy efficiency of the whole process. The use of water is reduced by 30.000L per hour and the automated equipment also reduce personal costs.</objective>
