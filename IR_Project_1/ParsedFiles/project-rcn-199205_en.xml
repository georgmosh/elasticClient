  <acronym>SELAM</acronym>
  <objective>The objective of SELAM is to commercialise and bring to market our exclusive and high-quality EU lobsters based on our disruptive and fully automated production process for lobster aqua and mariculture. The fully automated SELAM process is combining land-based aquaculture of hatched eggs through the larval (1-3) and juvenile (4-5) stages before released into sea-ranching ocean mariculture, where growth happens without human interference and at no cost. Combined with our novel business model for shellfish sea ranching this will allow us to bring a new product to the market – sustainable and high-quality farmed EU lobster with significant added value for the customer compared to existing wild-caught alternatives.

The SELAM concept was developed during our Phase I-type Feasibility Study - the FP7 NEPHROPS project, GA286903 - where the outcome was a novel production process with optimal production parameters (feed, light, temperature &amp; water quality) at TRL7. Now we seek to op develop our Commercialisation Plan and final Business Innovation Plan (BIP). We have assembled a highly competent team holding all required resources, skills, facilities and networks to advance SELAM into a successful commercial product.

To successfully introduce SELAM to the market, we have created 5 sequential and quantifiable Commercialisation Objectives focusing on overcoming remaining barriers hampering successful commercialisation:

1. Technology maturation, elevating our SELAM process from TRL7 to TRL8 (WP1)
2. Large scale piloting bringing SELAM to TRL9 (WP2)
3. Supply chain development, up- and downstream (WP3)
4. Product exploitation strategy development, market research and post-project funding (WP4)
5. Innovation management and BIP development, IP management and stakeholder engagement (WP5)

SELAM will significantly boost our growth - quantified as accumulated revenues exceeding €151m for the 10-years post project with accumulated gross profit €94.9m and employment growth of 52 FTEs.</objective>
