  <acronym>INCLUSION</acronym>
  <objective>The main objective of the INCLUSION project is to understand, assess and evaluate the accessibility and inclusiveness of transport solutions in European prioritised areas, identify gaps and unmet needs, propose and experiment with a range of innovative and transferable solutions, including ICT-enabled elements, ensuring accessible, inclusive and equitable conditions for all and especially vulnerable user categories.
INCLUSION will address a large set of case studies (at least 50) involving different forms of geographical areas and transport contexts, demographic categories, population groups and mobility solutions, providing concrete experiences from various European sites and pilot initiatives involving a variety of regulatory and business frameworks, supporting technologies, organisational and operational conditions.  Complementary to this, a number of innovative solutions will be concretely tried out and validated through real-life experiments (Innovation Pilot Labs) in a mix of urban, peri-/sub-urban and rural target areas in Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain and the UK, offering a variety of different transport environments, socio-economic contexts, cultural and geographical conditions.
Expected results include: an understanding of the main challenges affecting transport provision and accessibility in the different type of prioritised areas; a structured view highlighting the dependencies among spatial and environmental characteristics, populations segments and their mobility needs; in-depth examination of 10 innovative PT approaches and a wider catalogue of at least 40 promising cases contributing to more accessible, inclusive and equitable transport solutions, complemented by innovative solution components validated in real-life experiments; a set of recommendations  and an “option generator” for the development and deployment of mobility solutions addressing the needs of vulnerable user communities in European prioritised areas</objective>
