  <objective>FIBFAB project aims to industrialize and launch successfully the production of biodegradable and sustainable polylactic acid (PLA) based fabrics (wool/PLA and cotton/PLA) for the applications in casual (men and womenswear), protective and workwear clothing, and to overcome current limitations of PLA fibres as real alternative to current fabrics (wool and cotton with polyester fibres).

Main FIBFAB project innovations are:

- To obtain a final clothing product 100% bio-based and biodegradable that meets the mechanical and performance requirements of the textile sector 

- To improve the current poor thermal resistance of PLA fibres to meet the requirements in several clothing applications by adding additives to enhance the final PLA crystallinity. 

- To improve the extrusion process for PLA fibres and especially the mechanical spinning process 

-To introduce in the textile market yarns and fabrics produced from PLA fibres combined with cotton or wool.</objective>
