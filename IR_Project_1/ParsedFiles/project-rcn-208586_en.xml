  <objective>The main target is to provide a de-radicalized exegesis of violence against the Other in the Qur’an: from the first verse pronounced in chronological order to the last, without altering the historical reality and thus the cruelty of the Prophet Muhammad’s age, but deconstructing the sources of  contemporary neo-Salafist fundamentalism. Violence in its religious premise as well as its adoption in Islam, has become a normal praxis both in reference to a sharp increase in internal conflict: not only between Sunni and Shi’a, but among Muslims who support different radical points of view in relation to other religions: Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhist and atheism. This topic could be considered very popular; however, the exegetical studies that focus on each individual verse on the relationship between the Islamic revelation and the violence against non-Muslims, are limited and usually not linked to a historical-critical and metaphorical approach. This work raises the triple target of understanding, first of all, where and when every single verse of “violence” was pronounced, the historical exegetical interpretation in relation to a literary and metaphorical understanding and finally the trivialized deconstruction adopted by Islamic fundamentalism today.</objective>
