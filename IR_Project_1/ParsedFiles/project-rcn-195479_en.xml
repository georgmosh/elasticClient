  <objective>The research activities planned will be devoted to development, test and characterization of novel thin-disk structures based on epitaxially grown monoclinic double tungstate crystals for use in high average /peak power all-solid-state laser systems operating in the important 2-µm spectral range. Laser gain will rely on the Holmium (Ho) trivalent ion which is potentially very suitable for high energy due to its advantageous spectroscopic features. The latter allow one to excite it directly into the upper laser level, producing less heat and enabling power scaling with diode pumping. Moreover, wavelengths slightly above 2 µm, emitted from such tunable Ho-lasers, are attractive for various applications.</objective>
