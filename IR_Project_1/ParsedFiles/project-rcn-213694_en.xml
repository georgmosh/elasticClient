  <acronym>NRGDriver</acronym>
  <objective>Since its inception, LEDs are driven by a constant voltage or current with some compensation for temperature fluctuations. As the power grid works on alternating current, a rectifier circuit is required, in virtually all cases combined with a DC convertor. This type of circuitry is constructed along the principles of a switched mode power supply, which requires a reactance. In short: current LED lamps contain complex constructed technologies, which limits lifetime, reduces design versatility and increases costs.

We take a different approach. NRGDriver is built by discrete components and semiconductors. The size of the solution does not grow with increasing power requirements and it comprises only about 10 components: less components means less cost, less failure and less waste of energy. While current drivers are considered to be the Achilles’ heel for LED lighting, the concept of NRGDriver offers a breakthrough in LED driver technologies, making possible the same revolution in size, function and cost as happened to mobiles phones – but now in 1 jump.

So far, we have invested more than €1.5M into the development of the NRGDriver to ensure its robustness and efficiency. We now seek further investments of about €1.45M. This sum will allow us to surpass the so-called “valley of death” and reach commercialization.

The proposed work in Phase 1 of the SME instrument fits into our overall plan to reach the market by contributing the financial resources needed to plan a fast sound wider deployment of NRGDriver and its market uptake.</objective>
