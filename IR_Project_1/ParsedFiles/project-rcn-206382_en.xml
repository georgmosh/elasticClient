  <acronym>PKAS-MW-DRY</acronym>
  <objective>Plasma Kraftâ€™s proposes to take an innovative drying technology for agricultural products from the pilot stage to full-scale production. The drying technology is versatile and allows for normal drying as well as drying to freeze dried quality without using vacuum or other energy intensive solutions. It is the most effective method for reduction of surface spores and pathogens. We have can ascertain that the product will be price competitive while providing at least 70% energy saving compared to drying equipment used in this industry today. The technology allows for very compact design that takes up less than 50% floor space compared to existing systems while still fitting on a single-floor production arrangement. The system is conveyor-based and fully automated allowing for continuous production and remote monitoring reducing labour cost and processing time. Temperature measurements in real time guides the software to provide ideal drying temperature that helps preserve the nutritional value of the dried food product.</objective>
