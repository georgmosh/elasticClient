  <acronym>HeartRater</acronym>
  <objective>The Proof-of-Concept grant seeks to develop a commercializable platform to quantify how sensitive individuals are to their own heartbeats.  This platform will have applications in clinical psychology, personalized medicine and beyond.
We each differ in the way we express or control our emotions, in the way we base our decisions on feelings, and react to stress or excitement.  A key determinant of these aspects on our behaviour is our sensitivity to changes in the emotional arousal of our bodies.  Faster stronger heartbeats accompany threat and other challenges, but this may translate as anxiety, sadness or anger depending on how we register and interpret these changes. 
This Proof-of-Concept grant aims to verify the innovation potential of the ideas and methods linked to the ERC advanced grant 324150 ‘Cardiac Control of Fear in the Brain’.  HeartRater will characterise an individual along dimensions of interoceptive ability, including the unique interaction between heartbeat signals and the processing of threat and fear.  
The Proof-of-Concept of grant will consolidate intellectual property rights and strategy, develop a technical prototype and undertake groundwork for marketing.</objective>
