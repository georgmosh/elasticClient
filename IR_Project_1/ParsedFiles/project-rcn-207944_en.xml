  <objective>OUITAXI (or WETAXI) aims at developing a taxi on demand and a taxi sharing service. The specific objective is to foster the use of taxis by:
- making the fare more convenient and competitive (share the ride and reduce the cost per single passenger)
- making the service more transparent (fixed fares defined through quotes)
Phase 1 of the SME instrument will allow for the realization of a feasibility study for the development and implementation of a taxi sharing service in the city of Turin and further expansion. The study will include a detailed business plan that takes into account market analysis, value proposition, customer validation, product validation, strategy and economics.</objective>
