  <objective>Taking inspiration from natural carriers, such as viruses, a new technology has been developed in
our laboratories part of an ongoing ERC starting grant project, Molecular Engineering of Virus-like
Carriers (MEViC). We created synthetic viruses using polymers and thus safer materials. They are
able of delivering high payload of specific drugs into cells with no detrimental effect. While testing for
anticancer therapies, we identified a synthetic virus capable of targeting almost exclusively
macrophages. We performed preliminary work showing that this can be successfully applied to
deliver antibiotics to rid of intracellular pathogens. This has now open a completely new possibility
whereas we can expand our technology for the treatment of several infections as well as to contribute
to the ongoing efforts in tackling antibiotic resistance.</objective>
