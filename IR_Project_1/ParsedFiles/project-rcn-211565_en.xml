  <acronym>ASSTRA</acronym>
  <objective>ASSTRA is an interdisciplinary training and research project that targets the development of advanced solid state transformer technology which enables a sustainable and flexible (‘Smart’), DC-equipped energy supply system with a large share of renewable energy sources. This futuristic electrification network has in its core a flexible power conversion unit, distributing electrical energy from sources to loads in a similar fashion as today’s internet hubs distribute information from senders to receivers. Specifically, this power conversion unit integrates state-of-the-art technology, such as Silicon-Carbide, in order to implement power electronics building blocks and magnetic components featuring breaking through performances, which will ultimately enable its industrial deployment. 

ASSTRA involves a two-partner network comprising the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) in the Netherlands and ABB Corporate Research Center in Switzerland as beneficiaries. These partners complement each other in order to cover the knowledge and expertise fields required for the proposed program. A board of 6 experienced supervisors will intensively work together across a multitude of disciplines, including power electronics engineering, mechanical engineering, software engineering, material sciences and magnetics design, to train and mentor 2 Early Stage Researchers who will have access to excellent research facilities and close coaching approaches at both locations</objective>
