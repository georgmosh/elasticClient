  <objective>Herein, we propose to design de novo (“from scratch”) the first upconverting metalloprotein. This will be achieved by
exploiting a new class of lanthanide coiled coils (LCC), to generate bimetallic derivatives. These will, for the first time,
combine the attractive photophysical properties of Ln complexes, with de novo designed coiled coil scaffolds capable of
selectively binding different Ln ions at well-defined and tuneable distances. This programme of work will provide a new
strategy for unlocking the full potential of science at the interface of biology and inorganic chemistry, by combining previously
unexplored ligands with traditional inorganic complexes, for applications beyond those offered by biology, such as
upconversion. The complementary expertise of Dr Sinha (bioinorganic synthesis and computational modeling) and the
supervisor Dr Peacock (metallopeptide design) offer the unique combination to realise the full potential of multimetallic
LCCs, and will, in conjunction with two planned short secondments, provide Dr Sinha with new and cutting-edge research
training.</objective>
