  <objective>ECCSEL aims at gaining recognition as a world-class research infrastructure based within leading European Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) institutions and knowledge centres. It will be due for registration in 2015, forming a legal entity allocating efforts and resources to selected scientific and technological aspects of the CCS chain. 
ECCSEL will enable high-ranking researchers and scientists from all regions of Europe (and from third countries) to access state-of-the-art research facilities to conduct advanced technological research actions relevant to CCS. 
The proposed project aims to :
• implement ECCSEL as a not-for-profit organisation consistent with the European Research Infrastructure Consortium legal framework ;
• initiate operations of ECCSEL as a world-class CCS research infrastructure in accordance with the principles developed during the preparatory phase;
• develop the research infrastructure to an upgraded common standard in terms of quality of services, management and access provision;</objective>
