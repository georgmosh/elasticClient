  <objective>As a result of the research undertaken in the NANOFORCELLS project (ERC-StG-2011-278860), Dr Montserrat Calleja’s team has successfully developed instrumentation for the investigation of cell mechanics. The NANOFORCELLS project proposes a tool-box of three converging technologies for the aim of discriminating cancer and healthy cells from their physical properties: AFM, label-free microscopy and nanomechanical sensors. The instrument object of commercialization through the FAST-SPECTRO project is the output of the second key technology development: label-free microscopy.  The research undertaken under ERC support has evidenced that cell lines with different degrees of tumorigenicity show different mechanical properties, a result confirmed by AFM and nanomechanical tests. Such results are found to have a potential interest for cancer diagnostics, We envision a high commercial potential of the technique. In order to accelerate the market entry of the results, the FAST SPECTRO “Proof of Concept” (PoC) project will focus on conducting a market feasibility study of the SMS instrument developed, as well as clarifying the IP position strategy and making an initial approach to potential partners and investors.</objective>
