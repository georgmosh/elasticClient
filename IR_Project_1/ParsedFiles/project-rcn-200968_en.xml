  <objective>This European Fellowship project will benefit the researcher by giving and enhancing the knowledge and skills for a future generation of CPSs which enjoy the unique feature of context-active resilience. With such new capability and training, the researcher is expected to realise his potential and gain his leading role at international level in CPS research community. 

Context-active resilience is a novel concept of CPS resilience proposed in this action, which emphasises active and even proactive response to the dynamic state of CPS and its users in real-time. CAR Patterns will be identified via the empirical analysis of practical CPS systems, and specified with the developed Meta-Intelligence and populated into a semantic repository. 

Due to the wide and critical roles of CPS in industry and society and the novelty of context-active resilience, the proposal is both timely and significant. Acting as a bridge, the project will simultaneously advance the theoretic approach and art of practice of this emerging topic, improve the competency and career of the fellow, enhance and complement the hostâ€™s research profile and infrastructure, and benefit the society, living, economy and related research communities significantly.</objective>
