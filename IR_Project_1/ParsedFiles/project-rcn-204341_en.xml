  <objective>Insignia Technologies has developed and run initial testing on time and temperature sensitive labels that are used to reduce food waste and monitor temperature abuse within the supply chain. To build on the small scale testing that has been carried out thus far, Insignia proposes to run a Phase 1 project with the aim of producing further prototype Freshtag labels that will be used in live trials with customers in Europe including Autogrill, Sodexo and The Co-Operative. Define optimal requirements from the test customers, attend FachPack in Nuremberg in September 2016 to showcase the technology, research developing markets and use all of the results and data gathered to structure a business plan that moves forward to large scale trials with a range of customers as part of a Phase 2 project.</objective>
