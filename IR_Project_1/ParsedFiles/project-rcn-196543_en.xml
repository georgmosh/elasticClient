  <acronym>ZOONOMARKS</acronym>
  <objective>Our major goal is development of simple to use point of care tests for zoonotic pathogens and viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF), and their validation for use in clinical research setting. 
Zoonosis is any process whereby an infectious disease is transmitted between different species of animals. The term zoonosis is here used specifically to refer to diseases that originate in other species of animal, but that get transmitted to humans. Zoonoses in which humans are infected may originate in either domestic animals or wildlife, such as insects, mammals, reptiles, bats, or birds. 
This application contains a draft business plan with feasibility study that verifies the technical and economic viability of the new diagnostics in the proposed clinical validation.
In phase 1 a comprehensive business plan will be produced aiming in phase 2 to develop a comprehensive rapid response diagnostic system for zoonotic pathogens and hemorrhagic fever viruses, with implications for surveillance of all emerging pathogens. Furthermore, in phase 2 the developed tests will be evaluated by end users of the tests â€“ by several research and clinical diagnostic laboratories.</objective>
