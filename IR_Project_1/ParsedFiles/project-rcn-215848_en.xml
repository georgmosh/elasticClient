  <objective>The aim of MagElastic is to turn into a “ready for market” technology an innovation  based on magnetoelastic micromotors, which was recently developed by FET-OPEN consortium ABIOMATER. It was demonstrated that such micromotors can function as microfluidic pumps, valves and stirrers, to manipulate liquids at microscopic scale. These properties show high potential in point-of-care (POC) diagnostics, since they allow for minimal volume of sample extraction, instantaneous application, and no reliance on the medical expertise or laboratory tools. The main objective of MagElastic is to set up a start-up/spin-off company for commercialising a blood plasma separation component which will enable to produce a range of point-of-care devices for diagnosis of many known illnesses. With only a prick of blood such a component can help saving a significant amount of time and costs, which are currently being lost in the necessity of involving specialised equipment and staff support to extract blood plasma. Because of it’s time efficiency, in some cases (such as Sepsis described below), such devices will allow to save lives. MagElastic will bring the current technology from TRL5/6 to TRL7 by engaging with early adopters that will test the new device in operational environment. Moreover MagElastic will pave the way for the commercialisation of the new device by meeting with potential customers, clients and commercial partners and facilitating access to potential investors. During the project, the University of Exeter and Platform Kinetics, owners of the results of the undergoing FET-OPEN project, will be supported by META Group, an experienced partner in exploitation of research results and access to investors.</objective>
