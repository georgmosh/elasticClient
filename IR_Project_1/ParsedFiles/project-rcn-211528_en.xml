  <objective>In this Proof-of-Concept project we will demonstrate the practical feasibility of a fundamentally novel transparent and
flexible Li-organic thin-film microbattery. The strong basis for the project is the new hybrid Li-organic electrode materials
discovered in the PI's ERC Advanced Grant Project “Molecular-Layer-Engineered Inorganic-Organic Hybrid Materials
(LAYERENG-HYBMAT)”. These hybrid thin-film materials are fabricated by the combined atomic/molecular layer deposition
(ALD/MLD) technique which uniquely allows for fabrication of highly conformal thin-film coatings on various flexible,
sensitive, functional and/or nanostructured surfaces. Within this PoC project we will (1) design and construct an actual
optimized all-ALD/MLD Li-organic battery cell, (2) confirm its optical transparency and mechanical flexibility as expected,
(3) identify the most potential applications for this new type of 3D thin-film microbattery, (4) assess its real-life business
opportunities, and (5) build up a network of academic and industrial collaborators for the further advancement of the novel
technology.</objective>
