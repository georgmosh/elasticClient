  <objective>SMART-LAYUP activities described in the present proposal will contribute to develop and validate an advanced process of hybrid materials automated lay-up for manufacturing of regional aircraft composite fuselage which allows a significant reduction of the overall production costs and manufacturing flow. After a developmental phase to be performed at MTORRES site, the innovative process and related machine will be validated and costs assessed through the execution of dedicated lay-up tests and fabrication of fuselage demonstrators at Topic Manager plant.</objective>
