  <objective>The rise of the sharing economy is changing the face of European business – creating opportunities for new entrants, challenges for incumbent players, and searching questions for all stakeholders. A recent study for the European Commission (April 2016) names “Assessing the size and presence of the collaborative economy in Europe” shows that activity in the sharing economy across Europe has accelerated over the past two years and the collaborative economy start-up scene across Europe is form by at least 275 different platforms.  By 2025, it is estimated that many areas of the sharing economy will rival the size of their traditional counterparts, with platforms generating Europe-wide revenues worth over €80bn and facilitating nearly €570bn of transactions .
The problem with the sharing economy is that is has grown too fast becoming a highly fragmented sector. To realise this potential and attract the mass market, sharing economy platform providers will need to overcome trust issues and promote a culture of sharing.
WONOWO offers a revolutionary business model offering a one-stop-shop and unique identity for collaborative economies in order to aggregate in one single platform all the third party services demanded by the consumers. The aim is to prevent fragmentation of the Single Market and boost collaborative economy high level competitiveness internationally potential, by providing a single and open platform and digital identity to drive growth while unlocking the value of underused assets by matching needs and haves. WONOWO facilitates the access, comparison and all-in-one management of collaborative services. This point is especially beneficial as it provide growth opportunities for innovative start-ups and existing European companies, both in their home country and across borders.</objective>
