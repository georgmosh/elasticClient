  <objective>In EU and Australia, every year thousands of square miles of forests and other lands burn due to wildfires. These fires cause important economic and ecological losses, and often, human casualties. Both EU and Australian governments are aware of how crucial it is to improve wildfires’ management and containment . Scientists from different specialties, both in EU and Australia, have already developed methods and models in order to  improve the management and decision process  pertaining to preparedness and response phases in case of bushfire. The present project, named Geospatial based Environment for Optimisation Systems Addressing Fire Emergencies (GEO SAFE), aims at  creating a  network enabling the two regions to exchange  knowledge, ideas and experience , thus  boosting the progress of wildfires knowledge  and the related development of innovative methods for dealing efficiently with such fires. 
More precisely, the GEO SAFE project will focus on developing the tools enabling to set up an integrated decision  support system optimizing the resources  during the response phase, through:
• Developing a dynamic risk cartography of a region with regard to the possibility of a wildfire. The task will involve data collection (satellite and remote sensors),  risk analysis and  development  of a tool   enabling to forecast fire extension i, and in particular to predict  fire and risk evolution during the response phase
• Designing and testing a resource allocation tool for the response phase using the dynamic risk cartography. One of the problems to consider will be the resource allocation for securing key places (schools, hospitals, ….) given time dependent constraints. Problems will be identified through connections with final users, and the proposed solutions will be tested on simulated data.
• Developing analyses of relevant management processes as well as training tools in order to facilitate the implementation of such solutionto be completed</objective>
