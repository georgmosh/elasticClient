  <objective>C-SERVEES aims to boost a resource-efficient circular economy in the electrical and electronic (E&amp;E) sector through the development, testing, validation and transfer of new circular economic business models (CEBMs) based on systemic eco-innovative services that include: (1) eco-leasing of EEE, (2) product customization, (3) improved WEEE management, and (4) ICT services to support the other eco-services. ICT tools (relying on QR codes) will be developed as the driver of the proposed eco-innovative services to take full advantage of the potential and synergies of two major revolutions of our time: the circular economy and the Industry 4.0. The project will thus contribute to transform the E&amp;E sector into circular and 4.0, raising new opportunities for end-users (such as their involvement in design or the access to a product as a service) and for social and solidarity economy (conducted by NGOs, like EMAUS, which employ people at risk of social exclusion to repair and prepare WEEE for re-use). The techno-economic, environmental and social viability of the new CEBMs will be validated through demonstrations dealing with four target products belonging to different EEE categories: large household appliances, IT equipment, telecommunications equipment, and consumer equipment. These EEE categories together account for 77% of WEEE collected in the EU.
The project will result in an estimated economic benefit of 57.03 M€ over the period 2022-2026, which taking into account the project budget (8.03 M€) yields a ROI ~ 7.1. Specifically, the project will generate in the mid-term an economic benefit of 28.4 M€/year, with about 355 green employees (including direct and indirect jobs) and a total reduction of 2,620 tonnes CO2 eq/year.
C-SERVEES (10 Member States and Turkey, including industry, end-users and researchers, ensures that strategic, design and implementation decisions) will be in line with business realities and set the foundation for realistic market-ready solutions.</objective>
