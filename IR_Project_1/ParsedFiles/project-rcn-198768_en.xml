  <objective>This project will serve to evaluate market opportunities of a newly invented technology for digital detection of reporter DNA
strands in protein analysis.
The purpose of my ongoing ERC project ProteinSeq is to develop technology and reagents for parallel, sensitive and
specific targeted protein analyses in plasma samples, lysates, etc. An important limiting factor for the broader adoption of
our technology is the cost and throughput of next generation sequencing and realtime PCR to read out the identities and
levels of reporter DNA strands that reflect the amounts of proteins in a sample.
In the course of the ERC project we have invented and patented a technique to greatly enhance each of the reporter
strands to prominent DNA objects that can be easily detected, identified and counted by fluorescence microscopy with
automated image analysis or through flow cytometry. We refer to this highly specific technique as super rolling circle
amplification or sRCA, and it involves two generations of RCA and combinatorial fluorescence detection of the large
products, each composed of hundreds of thousand repeats of specific tag DNA sequences.
In the proposed PoC project we will position our new technology against other readout techniques such as next gen
sequencing, realtime PCR and microarrays by identifying Needs, Approach, Benefits, Competition for sRCA. Potential end
users will be contacted to establish customer requirements, and we will evaluate freedom to operate and the extent of
monopoly for our invention. We will also specifically investigate means to distinguish many sRCA products by combinatorial
labeling schemes.</objective>
