  <acronym>JOS</acronym>
  <objective>JOS is the first Energy Surface with high-power and energy efficiency, a patented lighting and charging device system. It’s a
low-voltage electrified panel, on which it’s possible to feed any electronic device without any cables, in numberless position
and with an energy saving of up to 25% compared with traditional systems.
JOS can also be powered with direct photovoltaic and it’s extensible in series even on very large areas, so to use a single
power supply and protect the environment.
All spaces fed with JOS will enjoy a strong reduction of electromagnetic emissions. The panel has the virtue of thermal
insulation and sound absorption, exploitable in the context of inner installation.
JOS technology offers a very different technology and is characterized by: INTEGRATION of all types of devices, HIGH
POWER (100 W per connection), FLEXIBILITY in positioning (table, wall, ceiling), ENERGY SAVING, CUSTOMIZATION
(functional and design).
JOS is not just a product but a technology with a double value proposition, both B2C and B2B. JOS B2C - Consumer
Electronics, huge market. PLUS: integration, savings, flexibility, elimination of wires.
JOS B2B - Great alternative or integration to traditional installation - panels of custom formats, extensible in series with
specific devices. PLUS: reduction of time and costs in all phases, no longer traces or wiring, or structural interventions for
changes, electromagnetic healthiness, energy saving.
A technology adaptable to many different contexts, including disability, multiplying and simplifying the access to energy, with
a strong facilitation of social and working conditions.
Because JOS is a system with many possible applications, the feasibility study will be particularly aimed at the study of
various business models, according to the different contexts and at detailed analysis of the various markets.
The first true answer to avoid the need of CO2 polluting batteries in the near future.</objective>
