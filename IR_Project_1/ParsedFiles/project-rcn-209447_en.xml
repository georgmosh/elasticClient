  <objective>Communication strategy and tools for optimizing the impact of Ebola vaccination deployment.

The EBODAC consortium consists of 4 partners: Janssen (EFPIA), London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), World Vision of Ireland and Grameen Foundation . These partners have experience and expertise in:
•	(Ebola) vaccine development and vaccine acceptance; m-health deployments for disease management in resource limited settings (Janssen)
•	Vaccine acceptance; risk management in health programs (LSHTM)
•	Mobile health deployments for emergency assistance; communication and training delivery in emergency settings (World Vision)
•	Mobile health software development and deployment in resource limited settings (Grameen)

As such, the EBODAC consortium is well placed to tackle the challenges associated with Ebola vaccine deployment, including:
•	Stigma related to Ebola infections
•	Lack of understanding and distrust versus vaccines in general in the local endemic communities
•	Two step prime/booster regimen for Ebola vaccine: risk for a ‘no show’ for the booster shot, risk for presenting for the booster shot too early or too late; risk for a different person presenting for the booster shot vs. the prime shot
•	People may be difficult to reach for the vaccine recall; People may live at a large distance from the health center where the vaccine is delivered
•	Risk for data on vaccine coverage to be fragmented, not existing or incorrect

The EBODAC consortium is committed to deliver:
•	A communication strategy that will optimize vaccine acceptance, supported by local anthropology research data
•	A platform, based on mobile phone technology, for Ebola vaccine recalls, information/education on Ebola and vaccines in general; and tracking of vaccination coverage 
•	An identification tool to allow to match the identity of individuals in the prime and boost vaccine regimens
•	A training program in the local setting, and a helpdesk function, to support the m-health platform, and the communication strategy deployment

The project currently is designed to take 3 years, but will have to synchronize with the timelines and outcome of the IMI2 Ebola+ Call, Topic 1.</objective>
