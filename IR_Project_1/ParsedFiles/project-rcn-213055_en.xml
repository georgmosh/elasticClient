  <objective>The project MiLEDI aims to realise micro-Light Emitting Diodes (mQDL) and micro -Organic Light Emitting Diodes (mQDO) using direct laser or electron beam patterning of nanometer-scale Quantum Dots (QDs) to write the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) arrays for display manufacturing.
The main idea sustaining the project is to form the colored green-red light-emitting QDs directly over a matrix of blue emitting micro QDL/QDO arrays, so that the QDs act as frequency down-converters and constitute a RGB micro-display.
Both direct-writing technologies will be thoroughly developed to optimize the QD light emission spectrum of the display and its stability. They are expected to provide patterning resolution at micrometric scales, depending on the laser spot areas and particle beam dimensions and operation. 
These techniques together with the direct formation of QDs assure highly flexible and simpler manufacturing processes, in few steps and with low chemical impact The MiLEDI approach for both micro QDL and QDO RGB displays manufactured by direct laser/electron beam patterning of QDs, is  validated by the production of a final prototype of Rear Projection display through the existing supply chain of the project.</objective>
