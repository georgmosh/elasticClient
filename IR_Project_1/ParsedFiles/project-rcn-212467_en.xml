  <objective>Bovine tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium bovis and other members of the M. tuberculosis complex, is a serious global disease with significant impact on animal health, public health, and international trade. This study will focus on investigating the feasibility of a non-invasive methodology for the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis in cattle. Our approach will be based on the detection via volatile organic compounds of the disease fingerprint in several non-invasive samples, employing analytical methods and chemical sensing devices.</objective>
