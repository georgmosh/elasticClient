  <objective>This project aims at turning the novel approach to automated delineation of complex curvilinear structures we have developed under ERC funding into industrial-grade software that can be commercialized. Our primary goal will therefore be to transform our research software into user-friendly plugins with well-defined APIs that can be bundled with widely used commercial software platforms.  

In the neuroscience and biomedical    areas,   we    have   identified    three   such platforms and will explore potential licensing agreements with the companies selling them. In the field of aerial cartography, we have close links to an EPFL spin-off company that could help us break into this very different market. 

We will also investigate the feasibility of launching a new startup company to carry out any further development that might be required. To this end, we will conduct a market study to assess the size of the market and develop a business plan.</objective>
