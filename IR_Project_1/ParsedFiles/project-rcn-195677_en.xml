  <objective>This study aims to shed light on the gendered geographies of gentrification. It examines and compares the mutual reconstruction of space and gender in gentrifying neighborhoods in Amsterdam and Istanbul. It employs Henri Lefebvreâ€™s theory of space to shed light on different dimensions (conceived, perceived and lived) of the reconstruction of space and gender during gentrification processes. The research uses a comparative qualitative methodology and combines different data collection methods (in- depth interviews, document analysis, participant observations).  
With its innovative use of methods and theories across disciplines and its novel focus on production of gender inequalities during gentrification, this research will contribute to the state of the art of urban and gender studies. By doing so, it will not only contribute to the excellence in science but also help increase awareness for gender inequalities, two principles promoted by Horizon 2020 Program.</objective>
