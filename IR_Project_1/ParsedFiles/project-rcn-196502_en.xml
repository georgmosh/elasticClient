  <objective>Breakthrough gene expression search engine for cost reduction and significantly increased use of open data in drug discovery. We are putting the power of genetic data analytics into the cloud and providing this as an easy to access service to biologists via a search engine. The challenge today is that as the field of sequencing is developing at a rapid pace and the amount of genetic data is exploding, nobody really can analyze all that data and pull it up when needed for making informed decision in the field of drug development and life science research. We are seizing this business opportunity through our competitive edge by creating an easily usable cloud-based gene expression search engine on top of publicly available datasets that have been analyzed and indexed by our advanced algorithms. This allows for providing unexpected discoveries in the field of drug discovery at a significantly reduced rate and insight, which has not been possible before.â€ƒ</objective>
