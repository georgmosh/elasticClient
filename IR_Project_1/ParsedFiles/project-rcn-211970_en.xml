  <acronym>CONNECTIVE</acronym>
  <objective>CONNECTIVE project will be part of Shift2Rail (S2R), the first rail joint technology initiative focused on accelerating the integration of new and advanced technologies into innovative rail product solutions. CONNECTIVE aims to be the technical backbone of S2R´s Innovation Programme 4 (IP4), which addresses the provision of “IT solutions for attractive Railway services”.
Thereby, CONNECTIVE will provide other S2R-IP4 projects with a technical framework and a set of tools that will foster the digital transformation of the rail and in general all the transport ecosystem, allowing to reach unprecedented multimodal travel experiences and to improve the fit between supply and demand. CONNECTIVE will provide new levels of interoperability and seamless access to all transport data and services in a multimodal and distributed environment, while offering a common business intelligence to extract insights of the ecosystem, valuable for both users and service providers.</objective>
