  <objective>Nanowire solar cells are an innovative and promising way to further reduce the cost of photovoltaic electricity for terrestrial applications. Accordingly, the ultimately goal of this project is to develop a multi-junction solar cell composed of an array of III-V nanowire subcells, electrically connected to a state-of-the-art Si solar cell. In order to do so, two different epitaxial techniques will be used to accomplish the epitaxial growth of the nanowires: standard MOVPE growth and the ground-breaking technology of Aerotaxy. Then, the nanowires will be embedded in a polymer and transferred to a Si substrate. 

The project will be undertaken at Lund University, a world renowned and leading research center in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The project includes not only the development of cutting-edge nanotechnology applied to photovoltaics, but also a comprehensive training program in transferable skills. A secondment in Sol Voltaics AB is also scheduled to assure the inter-sectoral transfer of knowledge, which in turn contributes to the establishment of a knowledge-based European economy. Therefore, the project represents in several ways a valuable opportunity to the researcher and to Lund University.</objective>
