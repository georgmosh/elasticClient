  <objective>The FUTURE-RADAR project will support the European Technology Platform ERTRAC (the European Road Transport Research Advisory Council) and the European Green Vehicle Initiative PPP to create and implement the needed research and innovation strategies for a sustainable and competitive European road transport system. Linking all relevant stakeholders FUTURE-RADAR will provide the consensus-based plans and roadmaps addressing the key societal, environmental, economic and technological challenges in areas such as road transport safety, urban mobility, long distance freight transport, automated road transport, global competitiveness and all issues related to energy and environment. FUTURE-RADAR will also facilitate exchange between cities in Europa, Asia and Latin America on urban electric mobility solutions. The FUTURE-RADAR activities include project monitoring, strategic research agendas, international assessments and recommendations for innovation deployment as well as twinning of international projects and comprehensive dissemination and awareness activities. Overall it can be stated that FUTURE-RADAR provides the best opportunity to maintain, strengthen and widen the activities to further develop the multi-stakeholder road transport research area, for the high-quality research of societal and industrial relevance in Europe.</objective>
