  <acronym>SOLVE</acronym>
  <objective>Founded in 1963 in Reggio Emilia (Italy), our company OMCA SRL (www.omcasrl.it) has grown to become one of Europe’s leading manufacturers of bevelling and chamfering machines (i.e. “cutting” angled edges), mainly used in construction, mining and shipbuilding industries. Our continuous investment in advanced technology and our commitment to quality and customer service has helped solidify our position as one of Europe’s leaders with approximately 10% market share and €2M in annual revenues.
 
This project, known as SOLVE (simultaneous plate bevelling), provides an optimum quality and a significant throughput improvement that will decrease bevelling times by 50% compared with current market offerings. 
We have invested so far €175,000 in validating and testing our First Prototype (10kW engine power) in a controlled environment (TRL6). Our preliminary market research also indicates that the increase in productivity for our clients address a core need that will provide them with a clear operational advantage over their competitors. For our company, we expect Solve to further solidify our position as a leading player in the bevelling machine tool industry and provide us an estimated 60% increase in sales revenues, resulting in a total revenue of €3.2M by 2021.</objective>
