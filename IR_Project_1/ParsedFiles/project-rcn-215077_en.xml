  <objective>The emission of greenhouse gases is gradually changing the climate and the temperature of the Earth. As a consequence, droughts are increasingly occurring and freshwater is becoming a scarce natural resource. Water scarcity is actually a major issue in the south of the European Union (EU) territory. Since industry is one of the main water users in Europe, the purpose of this Fellowship is to recover water from industrial gas streams at moderate temperatures around 200–300 degrees Celsius using porous aluminium oxide membranes. Assuming that this challenging separation is successfully achieved, the project will have major impact on the industrial water footprint and management. In addition, this Fellowship also aims to give the Fellow, Dr Masó, the opportunity to develop new technical and transferable skills in the state-of-the-art membrane methodology and incorporate him into the EU academic/industrial membrane community.</objective>
