  <acronym>MY-GATEWAY</acronym>
  <objective>"The overall concept of MY-GATEWAY builds around the growth potential boost of CEE start-ups on a pan-European level by exploiting the Consortium partners' Startup Europe experience (as former coordinators and partners of the ICT-13 projects) and by implementing actions aimed at creating new opportunities and synergies within and beyond the MY-GATEWAYâ€™s ecosystem. As a result of the project the CEE start-ups and the startup support organizations representing them will have better access to networks, finance and talent and will acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to maximise their growth potential. 
Moreover, the project will actively contribute to the expansion of the Startup Europe Community by opening the GATE of the Startup Europe to the Balkans. MY-GATEWAY involved the leading startup support organizations from Serbia, Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina (as members of its Balkan Committee) who will continuously follow up the project activities, facilitate the knowledge transfer - MY-GATEWAY KEY - to the Balkan region and mobilize the Balkan start-ups to set up the ""Startup Europe comes to the Balkans"" Network."</objective>
