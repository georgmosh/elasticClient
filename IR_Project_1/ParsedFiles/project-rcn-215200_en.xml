  <objective>VaLiD aims to reconsider the nature and the significance of deviant spellings and errors in Latin inscriptions in the light of territorial and sociological diversities, by applying modern approaches to the ancient materials. The privileged field of study will be the Roman province Hispania Citerior but comparisons with other territories represent an essential aspect of the investigation. The project is expected to return important information about the spoken Latin of Hispania as well as about the literacy levels of the province, focusing on the social and gender components of the Hispanic society.</objective>
