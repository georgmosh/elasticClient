  <objective>Borealis project presents an advanced concept of machine for powder deposition additive manufacturing and ablation processes that integrates 5 AM technologies in a unique solution. The machine is characterized by a redundant structures constituted by a large portal and a small PKM enabling the covering of a large range of working cube and a pattern of ejective nozzles and hybrid laser source targeting a deposition rate of 2000cm3/h with 30 sec set-up times. The machine is enriched with a software infrastructure which enable a persistent monitoring and in line adaptation of the process with zero scraps along with number of energy and resource efficiency optimization policies and harvesting systems which make the proposed solution the less environmental invasive in the current market.
Borealis idea results from a consortium composed by the excellence of developers of worldwide recognized laser machines and advanced material processing together with the highly precision and flexible mechatronic designers. These two big clusters decided to join their expertise and focus on new manufacturing challenges coming from complex product machining in the field of aerospace, medtech and automotive represented by major partners in the market. 
Borealis project targets a TRL 6 and will provide as outcome of three years work two complete Borealis machine in two dimensions – a lab scale machine and a full size machine – which are foreseen to be translated into industrial solution by 2019.</objective>
