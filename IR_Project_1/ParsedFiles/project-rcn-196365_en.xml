  <objective>ACOFORS has been designed with the ultimate goal of preparing commercialisation of Acoustic Force Spectroscopy (AFS). AFS is a completely new and powerful technique for determining biomolecular mechanics and structure of single molecules such as DNA and proteins. These studies are performed on a large scale by biologists and within pharmaceutical companies for e.g. drug discovery and development. Current technologies for force spectroscopy (FS) represent a $50+ million market, but are expensive, require high levels of specialism and are laborious. AFS, invented in the laboratory of Prof. Wuite, is much simpler to use, can be operated in high-throughput mode and can become available at relative low cost. As such, AFS vastly expands the possibilities of FS and makes it available to a much wider community. This makes AFS a very attractive technology for science and business, both from the perspective of the user and of the seller.    
In ACOFORS, a team of scientists and business developers will transform the current prototype in a marketable product, strengthen the intellectual property position, build a solid business case based on an extensive market analysis and take steps towards licensing the technology to industry.</objective>
