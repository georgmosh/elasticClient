  <acronym>FLOTA</acronym>
  <objective>The innovation project consists in a system of floating photovoltaic panels for the decentralized generation and stocking of energy at off shore fish farms (and more generally sea activities with necessity of electricity). The project FLOTA (Floating Offshore Photovoltaic systems) addresses the industrial problem of the autonomous supply of sustainable and green energy for the quickly increasing industrial branch of fish farms.
Goals of this feasibility study is to finalize the business plan for the development of a new company of a spin-off fully dedicated to sea advanced systems, the finalization of specific design activities on the system and the creation of a small scale demonstrator that will be the key element of the dissemination for this system.</objective>
