  <objective>Theseus is designed to bring commercial aviation-grade reliability, engineering standards and extreme operation safety into an unmanned air vehicle platform. 
The area where UAV utility is greater is the one of the one of scarcely accessible infrastructure needing accurate monitoring such as high voltage electro ducts or waste repositories in urban environment.
Medium size UAV with Hybrid (endothermic and electrical) motors and VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Lamding), with long autonomy (&gt; 8 hours), could discharge the task.</objective>
