  <objective>The overall goal of the RE4-Project is to promote new technological solutions for the design and development of structural and non-structural pre-fabricated elements with high degree of recycled materials and reused structures from partial or total demolition of buildings. The developed technology will aim at energy efficient new construction and refurbishment, thus minimizing environmental impacts. The RE4-Project targets the demonstration of suitable design concepts and building elements produced from CDW in an industrial environment, considering perspective issues for the market uptake of the developed solutions. The technical activities will be supported by LCA and LCC analyses, certification and standardization procedures, demonstration activities, professional training, dissemination, commercialisation and exploitation strategy definition, business modelling and business plans. 
The overarching purpose is to develop a RE4-prefabricated  energy-efficient building concept that can be easily assembled and disassembled for future reuse, containing up to 65% in weight of recycled materials from CDW (ranging from 50% for the medium replacement of the mineral fraction, up to 65% for insulating panels and concrete products with medium mineral replacement coupled with the geopolymer binder). The reusable structures will range from 15-20% for existing buildings to 80-90% for the RE4-prefabricated building concept.</objective>
