  <acronym>TENCENT</acronym>
  <objective>Brenmiller Energy has developed a unique 50kW Concentrating Solar Power pilot plant which final aim, after upscaling it, is to become the most innovative and cost-effective available technolgy to harness the power of the Sun and convert its energy into electricity at a price of 10€cent/kwh. The TENCENT project is made out of three main blocks that constitute the basic unit of 1.5MW called bCell.  These three blocks collect the sun radiation through patented i)tube collectors filled in with a novel ii)Heat Fluid Transfer which will take the heat to an exclusive iii)Energy Center that will distribute or store the energy generated in the form of &gt;500ºC. The generated heat will actuate a power turbine that will generate clean energy 24/7. Brenmiller Energy will access over 30 countries to participate in national power tenders hand by hand with Gestamp Renewables and expect to generate a turnover over 1,000M€ over the firsr five years of commercialization. The TENCENT project constitutes a breakthrough in the path to a cleaner, safer and more fair future for Europe and the world.</objective>
