  <objective>Atom interferometry provides extremely sensitive measurements of quantities such as rotations and accelerations. This project will theoretically investigate how quantum entanglement between atoms and photons can enhance the sensitivity of atom-interferometry. The aim of this project is to drastically enhance the sensitivity of atom interferometers, to deliver practical sensing devices of unprecedented sensitivity. This increased sensitivity may lead to new technologies, such as ultra-sensitive gravity gradiometers for the detection of mineral reserves, as well as important applications to fundamental physics, such as tests of fundamental theories beyond the standard model.</objective>
