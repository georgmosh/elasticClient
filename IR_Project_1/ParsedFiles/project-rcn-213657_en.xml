  <objective>A hybrid solar panel that maximises heat capture and electricity generation.  Although solar panel technology is well established, commercial hybrid panels are a recent innovation. A typical PV panel transforms ~20% of incident solar irradiance into electricity – and a thermal panel several times that, into heat. Between the two, there are trade-offs; and the detailed economics – factoring in power prices and other heating costs, etc. – can be very complex. In the end, however, people/businesses need continuous electricity and regular hot water. There is clear need for a solution that delivers both: hence the development and uptake of hybrid panels. The battle is to establish technology (efficiency) leadership – which EndeF has achieved in ECOMESH: the most efficient panel ever built. At the core of the innovation is ECOMESH’s Transparent Insulating Cover (TIC) technology: an advanced heat recovery system which, using an inert gas layer, maximises heat capture. TIC also increases electricity generation by 15%, by cooling the PV cells to their optimum operating temperature.</objective>
