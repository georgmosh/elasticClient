  <acronym>E-SPECTR</acronym>
  <objective>This sensing technology is based on the excitation-response dynamics of samples (organic objects and materials, tissues or fluids) embedded into alternating electric field. The system of samples-in-electric-field is excited in optical, magnetic or thermal way. Varying the frequency of the e-field, an analysis of excitation patterns over the frequency and time delivers information about structure, behavior and dielectric/electrochemical properties of objects and materials. Fully operational prototypes of the excitation spectrometer are produced; they demonstrated a high sensitivity and resolution of this approach, for instance, the sensor is able to detect small physicochemical differences between samples. The innovative applications are detections of low-concentrated chemical contaminations and non-chemical treatments in water quality monitoring, and an express identification of complex biochemical substances in field conditions (demonstrated in wine/honey production). The technological and economic impacts – as the enabling technology – are generated in the fields of material analysis in biology/chemistry, biotechnology, material science, and robotics. This sensing approach was awarded to the finale of Innovation Radar Prize 2016 in the category ‘Excellent Science’. The proposal describes a concrete strategy for targeting a global market of sensor devices. It is complementary to the ASSISI|bf project and allows extending its technological impact.</objective>
