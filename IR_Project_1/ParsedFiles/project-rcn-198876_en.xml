  <objective>Wallco will develop furniture designed to meet the needs of people by creating modular wooden furniture that is creative, sustainable, versatile, user-friendly, and developed with user-led design paradigms. This concept will provide useful furniture that meets the changing demands of users for years to come and is founded on sustainability concepts including renewable material use, recycling, and material cascading.

Conceptually, Wallco’s modular wood furniture follows the LEGO toy bricks paradigm – widely customisable, reusable, repurposable, easy to work with, and fun. In addition to the versatility of LEGO Bricks, their use prompts creativity and offers endless options with a very successful underlying business model. Like LEGO Bricks, Wallco will provide a business model based on expansion of the owners collection. The versatility of the product will prompt users to come up with their own uses for the product, generating demand for expanding the owner’s collection of components as their needs and preferences change.

The novelty of this project is the combination of both the innovative products and the innovative service that supports our products. The innovative products are quality modular solid wood furniture that are very versatile. The supporting service will include online and physical furniture stores where customers have access to our products and learn about the advantages that Wallco products and support service offer.</objective>
