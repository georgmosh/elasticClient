  <objective>INTERMIN will create a self-sustainable long-term lasting international network of training centres for professionals. This project involves educational and research institutions in the EU and the leading counterparts in third countries, based on specific country expertise in the primary and secondary raw materials sectors. The network will map skills and knowledge in the EU and the third countries, identify key knowledge gaps and emerging needs, develop roadmap for improving skills and knowledge, as well as establish common training programmes in the raw materials sectors. In line with the EU's strategy for international co-operation in research and innovation (COM(2012)497), the consortium will seek international collaboration, fostering and exploring  synergies with the relevant EU Member States initiatives</objective>
