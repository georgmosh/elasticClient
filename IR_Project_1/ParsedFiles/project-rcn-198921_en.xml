  <objective>Based on a novel smart design (patent pending) for ultrasonic Image data capture from solid materials like concrete, shall the project develop and implement a fully functional model of a hand held NDT/E (Non-Destructive Testing /Evaluation) instrument. This user friendly NDE tomograph (3D-scanner) shall be able to scan 10 times faster than the current state of the art instrument, with better resolution in a human readable format.  This innovative solution will simplify and improve current bridge inspection methods and consequently improve safety, enhance capital investments and road infrastructure capacity. This business project will be the fundament for future technological and commercial expansion for Elop. Validation of the instrument is performed by highly qualified expertise in bridge inspection and NDT (COWI Denmark, Ramboll Norway and Denmark). This validation will also be an introduction of the product to the end users and customers as part of the exploitation and dissemination work.</objective>
