  <objective>A new disposable sampling device that allows quantitative measurements from Dried Blood Spots (DBS) has been developed with support of the ERC AdG xMEMS.
The technology consists of a small microfluidic chip made of laminated structured plastic foils and paper with the specific function to meter and store an exact blood volume as a DBS. The chip can be used directly by a patient to leave a capillary blood sample straight from a finger prick. This
simplifies blood sampling, offers comfort for the patient and reduces costs for health care providers.
In this project we shall perform activities to:
Have a first complete product (proposed within TDM) that works for users and is backed up by clinical test(s).
A company is formed, the business plan is worked out in detail and it is ready for a next financing round.
IPR strategy has been chosen and patent(s) on blood as well as plasma are secured accordingly.
We have worked out and tested a scalable and cost-efficient manufacturing and packaging
strategy.
We have chosen, prepared and acquired our first paying customer. We are ready to sell and have a plan for how to grow sales for defined product(s).</objective>
