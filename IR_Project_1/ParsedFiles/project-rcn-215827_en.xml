Nowadays AIRC is the Italian leading charity providing about 40% of all funds invested in cancer research in Italy and supporting hundreds of research projects and fellowships in any cancer-related fields. Grants and fellowships are awarded with a merit-based selection process.

1. Let fellows choose the cancer-related topic of their research and the best supervisor and Hosting Institution, worldwide;
2. Offer and promote training in transferable skills, with a special focus on research integrity, science communication, grantsmanship, project management and intellectual property rights;
