  <objective>5G cellular networks are coming and they need to cope with major challenges in meeting the demands of large populations.
The rapid increase of mobile devices, wireless connections and the emerging internet services related to applications with
very diverse communication requirements (e.g., Smart grid, m-health, Smart cities), raised the need of higher capacity and
more energy efficient networks with improved coverage capabilities.
According to the 5G Public-Private Partnership (5GPPP) recently formed by the European Commission (EC), 5G networks
should be capable of providing 1000 times higher capacity with 0% downtime, enabling the roll-out of very dense wireless
networks that are able to connect over 7 trillion devices amongst 7 billion people.
5G STEP FWD aims at proposing, studying, optimizing, quantitatively assessing and comparing advantages and
disadvantages of hybrid fiber â€“ wireless architectures, topologies and technologies, which will significantly shape 5G
standards and will enable the requested 1000 times increase of spectral efficiency and 90% reduction of energy
consumption.</objective>
