  <objective>Cancer, the uncontrolled division and spread of cells, represents one of the most important causes of death in Europe and all over the world. Understanding how cells control their division is the key to comprehend and cure cancer. Eukaryotic cells divide through mitosis to produce new cells with identical DNA. Yet, mitosis has to be ended for the two cells to be separated to become individual cells with the capacity to further divide. This occurs by a process called mitotic exit. Mitotic exit is a critical step during cell division. Failure to control mitotic exit is the key cause of aneuploidy and genomic instability, which are hallmarks of cancer. Therefore, gaining a comprehensive knowledge of mitotic exit regulation will have significant impact on understanding and treatment of cancer. In this project, the researcher will uncover a novel mechanism that control exit from mitosis mitotic. This novel regulation has the potential to define a molecular target to fight cancer in long term. Researchers previous research experience puts her in a unique position to perform this project. This fellowship will also allow the researcher to build a successful academic career, to acquire new expertise and soft skills, and to establish future collaborations through dissemination, communication and training.  Furthermore with this fellowship, researcher will help increase public awareness of science through outreach activities.</objective>
