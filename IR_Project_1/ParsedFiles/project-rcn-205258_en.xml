  <acronym>BIOTREM</acronym>
  <objective>Project’s aim is to successfully commercialize BIOTREM technology – globally-unique, innovative and patented, sustainable method of processing by-products of the milling industry.

Using modified servo-presses, the technology, allows moulding wheat-bran into designated forms. After processing the mouldings gain market value as biodegradable packaging. Their main application concerns disposable tableware or food-service take-away-containers.

Biotrem packaging products are simultaneously bio-based, biodegradable within 30 days, use annually renewable agricultural side-products and are free of chemical additives. The above characteristics position Biotrem product line as a premium offer with environmental standards beyond its market counterparts.

Degradable packaging, as market research show, is the fastest growing niche of the packaging industry – a business opportunity the project plans to exploit, as it provides products that meet a demand generated by both legislation (imposing decrease of packaging waste) and consumer trends (environmentally conscious attitude). 

Having concluded necessary R&amp;D works and completing investments assembling the production line, the company currently strives to optimize the technology in operational conditions and to specify its short-medium and medium-long term business strategy.</objective>
