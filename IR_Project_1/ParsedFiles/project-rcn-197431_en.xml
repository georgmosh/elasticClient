  <objective>Visually impaired people are being left behind by the smart phone revolution. BlindShell helps them access modern touchscreen phones by providing a simple, cheap and intuitive software interface with a suite of communications tools, controlled by gestures. The innovative software is distributed in partnership with blind support associations. The feasibility study will prepare BlindShell for EU-wide expansion, and investigate the idea of releasing a BlindShell branded and tailored mobile handset for the visually impaired.</objective>
