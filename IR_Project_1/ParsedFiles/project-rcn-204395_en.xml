  <objective>Transparent packaging is important to businesses on many levels; creating an eye-catching presentation in which customers can see the product can boost sales (see adjacent figure), in operations the condition of the product can be inspected and labels such a barcodes can be read, handling is made easier and the product is protected. Traditionally dominant materials, for example polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are declining in use, while next generation bio-plastics still not in mainstream use, so polyethylene terephthalate – PET – is the industry’s star. The preferred type, amorphous PET (A-PET) is limited in its use due to unsolved manufacturing problems, leading industry to turn towards a glycol-modified version, PET-G, a more expensive and less environmentally-friendly option. Existing packaging machines, which support a variety of materials, are not optimised to handle A-PET, and the packaging quality is compromised. WEL-CUT is an innovative line of A-PET packaging machines that simultaneously achieve cost-effectiveness (A-PET requires less energy), quality (doesn’t compromise clarity nor toughness) and a product with lower environmental impact. As of today, it will be the first solution to produce quality welding for A-PET.</objective>
