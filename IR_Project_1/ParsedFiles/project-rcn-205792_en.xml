  <objective>SecTrap™ is a security suite that is built on our novel and proprietary Virtual Machine Behavioural Introspection (VMBI)
technology and complements existing software security systems already invested by organisations. SecTrap™ ensures that
protected assets are inaccessible to malicious software and uses advanced AI to detect, block and report abnormal
behaviours. We want to be the first to commercialise this novel solution that is designed to protect critical urban
infrastructures and soft targets against new and imminent cyber attacks. Through SME Instrument Phase 1, we are seeking
finance to prepare a Feasibility Study and Business Plan to determine in-depth the possibility, feasibility, risk, viability,
profitability and sustainability of this new project.</objective>
