  <objective>The OC-Tech project devises an innovative catamaran-vessel able to: [A] recover hydrocarbon spills, [B] deal with algal blooms and jellyfish infestations; [C] collect flotsam and jetsam. The main benefits of OC-Tech are: [1] Polyvalence: collecting all pollution episodes and has also a large deck for transporting personnel (12 p.) and loads (1.500kg/m2); [2] Multi-Purpose (Cleaning+Working vessel). OC-Tech goes beyond its core cleaning activity (recurring only purpose at other cleaning assets) and can carry up to 12 people thus operating as a conveyor for other operations: ship chandlers; beacons, buoys, barriers carrier; off-shore assistance; Fire protection assistance, cleaning+repair of other ships; Prospecting, diving platform, works; port services and multi-site cleaning work (docks, beaches, boats, bridges). As a relevant feature within multipurpose character, it has a velocity cleaning activities at 4 knots at Force 6 (Beaufort scale) at open sea, ports, inshore and rivers; [3] Maneuverability: four propulsion units. 2 main propulsion units at the rear of each hull and auxiliary thruster units located in each of the bows. The bow units allow generating and controlling a water flow between the two hulls, even while stationary, offering advanced collection possibilities; [4] Efficiency: collection+bagging system facilitates clean-up of 15 tons/hour of hydrocarbon spills (separation rate of 70-80%; no emulsion creation, which avoids additional effort for splitting water and hydrocarbon); [5] Easy Operation: Our proprietary OC-Tech collecting system avoids the need to go back to the port to upload the recovered hydrocarbon leading to savings in fuel and [man·hours] (≈55%); [6] Easy Transportation: OC-Tech foresees future modular design/construction/re-assembly to be conveyed by road/sea/air, leading to faster action than other options; [7] Profitability: OC-Tech will deliver cumulated revenue of €21.55M and cumulated profit of €10.365M by 2023.</objective>
