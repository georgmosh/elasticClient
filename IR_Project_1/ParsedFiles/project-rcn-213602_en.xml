  <objective>Osteosarcoma is a rare but devastating bone tumour that mainly affects children, adolescents and elderly. This type of tumour is very resistant to therapy, being thus urgent to find new effective treatments. In vitro tumour models can recapitulate many aspects of the natural tumour environment, and could be used to improve the predictive value of the effect of anticancer drug candidates. The aim of MicroBone is the development of biological relevant spherical-based 3D disease models that could be used as an enabling tool for personalized and precision drug discovery, increasing our understanding of the mechanisms behind bone cancer and testing new drug-based therapies.</objective>
