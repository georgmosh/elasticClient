  <objective>An innovative training structure focused on addressing the limited capability of young European ICT future entrepreneurs is needed. This is a challenging task, since existing European ICT entrepreneurship training initiatives are characterised by a general fragmentation and a lack of a ‘learning-by-doing’ training approach. STARTIFY7 is an innovative and ambitious project aiming to go beyond the state-of-the-art and create strong synergies with existing initiatives and projects. It suggests a unique approach to ICT entrepreneurial education for the youth, with the following objectives: 1) Perform a thorough Training Needs Analysis for the future ICT entrepreneurs. 2) Embed a team-building process within a lean-training structure. 3) Establish an effective network of trainers. 4) Create innovative lean-training curricula with thematic ICT focus. 5) Ignite competition and strong synergies with existing initiatives. 6) Disseminate, exploit and ensure long-term sustainability. 
The innovative outcomes of the project are the following: 1) Seven Summer Academies in 7 different European cities within a timeframe of two sequential summers (i.e. 2015 and 2016). 2) Seven lean-training and thematically-focused training curricula, embedding a strong team-building process. 3) An integrated network of trainers focused on hands-on and real-world knowledge transfer. 4) A competition based on the best performing teams after the completion of each round of summer academies. 5) Complement, extend and enrich similar existing actions. 6) A centralized social networking service. 7) ECTS credits provision. 8) An integrated exploitation and sustainability plan with the aim of making STARTIFY7 a long-term viable Summer Academy.
STARTIFY7 will aim for 1.400 applications from potential entrepreneurs, 280 student participants, 90 produced demos, 70 engaged teachers/coaches/mentors, 2 boot-camps with 63 participants, 10 VC/angels investors engaged, and, 16 investment-ready proposals.</objective>
