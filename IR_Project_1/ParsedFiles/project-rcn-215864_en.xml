  <objective>The proposal addresses the initial exploitation of a vast business opportunity for waste heat recovery (WHR) in industrial processes worldwide. 12-25% of national energy consumption in industrial countries is used for drying, one of many processes suitable for WHR.  The industries paper, petrochemical, food, wood and plastic have a moderate calculated potential need of 4400 high temperature heat pumps (HTHP) delivering heat between 100 and 150 oC in Europe alone.
There is a technology gap in the market for heat pumps delivering temperatures between 100 and 200 oC according to a comprehensive report from IERE (Stuttgart University), a necessity to fully exploit the vast potential in industrial processes. Tocircle is maturing its compressor and integrating it in a High Temperature Heat pump (HTHP) to fill this gap.
The first process to address is the European potato frying industry consisting of 250 known frying lines. Their energy (gas) consumption totals 8 TWh a year at a value of 210 M€. The corresponding emission is 1.5 Mt CO2. A reduction in fossil consumption by 70% can be achieved by integrating a HTHP in the deep-frying process.
The global market value of frozen French Fries is about 19 billion $ with Europe as the largest market, then North-America and Asia-Pacific. They represent the growth path for our potato frying solution.
Commercial objectives: Tocircle will reach annual HTHP sales of 63 M€ in Y3 after project completion, a profit of 16 M€ and creating 100+ new jobs in Europe from the European potato frying segment alone.
Technical objectives: to mature Tocircle’s patented rotary vane compressor using Evaporative Compression Technology (ECT), to integrate an ECT compressor package into a full-scale pilot HTHP system and to demonstrate the solution at one of 11 frying lines of company Aviko, a major international French fries producer.
ECT is a disruptive technology allowing the HPHT to deliver temperatures up to 200 oC.</objective>
