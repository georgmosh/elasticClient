  <objective>Abstract
OCEANERA-NET COFUND aims at coordinating the efforts of 8 agencies, in 4 Member states and 4 regions, in the ocean energy area. The joint action will focus on the demonstration and validation of innovative technologies for the generation of electricity from waves, tidal current, tidal range, salinity gradient and ocean thermal energy conversion, which will lead to improved performance, reliability and survivability of ocean energy conversion devices and arrays, and reduction in the levelised cost of energy (LCOE).   The project will comprise:
• A Co-funded Joint Call to support transnational, collaborative demonstration projects
• A second joint call to support transnational, collaborative research, development, demonstration and innovation  projects
• Joint activities to improve coordination between national / regional research programmes, coordinate with key stakeholders and promote knowledge transfer and exploitation of results
The project aims to build on European industrial leadership to help create a new industrial sector, which has potential to make a significant contribution to the decarbonisation of Europe’s energy system, economic growth, job creation, particularly in peripheral regions.
The consortium represents the leading countries and regions in the European ocean energy sector – Scotland (UK), Sweden, Spain, Basque Country (Spain), Ireland, Portugal and Bretagne and Pays de la Loire (France).</objective>
