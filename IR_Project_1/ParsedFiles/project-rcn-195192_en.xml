  <acronym>Woolvation</acronym>
  <objective>The main novelty of Woolvation project is the introduction of an eco-innovative cultivation block for vegetable production in greenhouses that is made from a natural raw material (sheep wool), and being 100% bio-degradable it will have no negative impact on the environment. The introduction of Woolvation blocks means an entirely new application for sheep wool, whose chain-of-use will become 100% sustainable, from farm to farm, or from farm to biogas. The overall Woolvation idea has the ambition to  
•	Give sheep wool a new recovery potential, which will reduce wasted sheep wool to a minimum
•	Minimise the use of rockwool in greenhouses, which become a hazardous waste after use
•	Provide a new soil amending product (mixed with manure or pure) to farmers
•	Provide new feedstock (mixed with manure) for bio-gas plants
To achieve that the aim of this Project is to study the feasibility of the Woolvation idea which will include a
a)technical feasibility tests
b)economic feasibility studies
c)business plan.</objective>
