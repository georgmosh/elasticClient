  <objective>"The increase demand of oil, associated with the depletion of easily exploitable oil deposits is leading the oil industry to intensify the search for new oil areas and exploit deposits previously considered as economically unprofitable. These new oil research areas are mostly located in Arctic waters and in the "offshore" areas in deep waters. However, very few studies have investigated the biological impacts of oil contamination in these very specific areas. Practically, the research actions will estimate the potential synergistic effect of oil, warming and hypoxia on a key Arctic species, polar cod Boreogadus saida (Work package 1, WP1).The project will then will focus on the impacts of the soluble fraction of oil on the metabolism of deep benthic species, in particular Lophelia pertusa and Eurythenes gryllus (WP 2). WP3 will consist of an applied study in order to validate two experimental set-ups which could make possible the assessment of the impact of oil in deep-sea environments. Finally, WP4 will be devoted to provide recommendations to perform a relevant NEBA in Arctic and deep-sea areas. The complementarities between the applicant and the supervisors profiles, associated with partner organizations skills ensure the realization of this innovative project and the dissemination and exploitation of the different results."</objective>
