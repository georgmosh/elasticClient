  <objective>Concrete bridge repair is the fastest growing infrastructure business globally. In Europe alone there are tens of thousands of bridges in need of repair. The constantly increasing maintenance backlog is huge and cannot be handled by traditional bridge repair methods in a manner that is fast and cost effective enough. There is an urgent need for modern solutions which could replace the slow and labour intensive conventional methods.

Fast Beam is a growing SME operating in the field of bridge repair and building. The company has developed a modular repair and newbuilding system for concrete bridges, with clear, demonstrated benefits against the traditional methods: e.g over 50% reduction in work effort, over 50% reduction in net work duration and up to 90% reduction of non-recyclable waste materials. This game changing innovation will offer construction contractors significant savings in time and cost, better productivity and sustainability as well as improved safety.

The global market potential for Fast Beamâ€™s patented system is vast, and the company is now ready to make a successful market entry in other European countries. FASTSCALE project studies the bridge repair market particularly in German and Nordic countries in order to assure successful market entry to Germany, a very promising market for Fast Beam.</objective>
