  <objective>With the market introduction of X-10 Pathology we aim to shape a new era of healthcare and drive clinical testing to play a major role in prevention, diagnosis and disease monitoring. We are targeting a group of inflammatory-related pathologies affecting about 15-20% of the world population, for which no specific diagnostic assay is currently available. We want to stop the spiral of repeated tests and specialist consultations and offer patients a simple and inexpensive test on a powerful device, to have their disease identified and monitored in an accurate and timely fashion. To honour our mission we have developed X-10 Pathology, the first-ever device with demonstrated diagnostic capability on the specific causes of inflammatory conditions. Born from the synergy of cutting edge technical and clinical expertise, our standalone platform aims to provide a simple, cost-effective device that empowers also non-specialized personnel to provide fast and specific answers to patients with a minimally invasive test, also in developing Countries. We believe that the disruptive concept of X-10 Pathology has the enormous potential of empowering the healthcare system in its race to balance limited resources with the need of reliable and cost-effective diagnosis and treatment to a growing and ageing global population. Considering the advanced stage of development of our product and the successful outcome of preliminary clinical tests, we target the launch of X-10 Pathology in 2018, after obtaining regulatory approval. By joining the global market of In Vitro Diagnostics we will contribute to the growth of this sector, expected to reach â‚¬ 66 billion by 2020. A feasibility study covering the technological, commercial and financial aspects will enable us to finalize our business plan and secure our steps towards the successful market launch.</objective>
