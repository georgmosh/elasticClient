  <objective>The proposed research concerns ancient scholarship on archaic Greek iambic poetry from the Hellenistic to the Byzantine period. It investigates the history of such scholarship in its various embodiments (editions, commentaries, marginal annotations, monographs on individual topics, author- and genre-specific lexica, and others) and the aims, concerns, assumptions, and techniques that it deployed. This investigation - the first of its kind - aims to contextualise such items of scholarship, and scholarship on iambos generally, within the broader picture of ancient literary scholarship. The study of ancient scholarship is a budding field, making the proposed research timely as well as necessary. Ancient scholarship has long been among my research interests. Given the Department's strengths on archaic Greek poetry and ancient scholarship, and Ca' Foscari's commitment to fostering research and supporting young researchers' skills development, Venice is the ideal partner for the success of the proposed research. Holding a Marie Sklodowska-Curie would be highly beneficial to my academic career and enable me to achieve independence as a professional researcher.</objective>
