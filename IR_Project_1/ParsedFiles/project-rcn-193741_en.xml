  <objective>An important responsibility of primary health care in most societies is to conduct regular check-ups of childrenâ€™s physical, cognitive, and social development, and to identify problems at an early stage to arrange for appropriate support and special care. Whereas well-validated methods exist for monitoring physical growth (e.g., WHO growth standards), there is a lack of standardized methods for monitoring other key aspects of early development (e.g., cognitive development). The present project examines the possibilities to develop novel solutions for assessing children's cognitive function. The project activities are aimed at developing the concept of new types of cognitive assessment techniques, testing of a prototype, and surveying end-user experiences and potential markets for the prototype.</objective>
