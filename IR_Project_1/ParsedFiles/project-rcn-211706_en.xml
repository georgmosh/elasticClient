  <objective>NOESIS project will identify the critical factors/features which lead to successful implementation of Big Data technologies and services in the field of transport and logistics with significant value generation from a socioeconomic viewpoint. This will be achieved through the examination of areas and contexts throughout Europe, in which ICT investments and exploitation of data should be implemented. The impact of Big Data will be evaluated in a series of transportation use cases (Big Data in Transport Library) by developing and applying a ‘Learning framework’ and a Value Capture mechanism which will estimate the expected benefits and costs.</objective>
