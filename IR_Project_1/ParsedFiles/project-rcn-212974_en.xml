  <acronym>KANTINSA</acronym>
  <objective>A consortium of 4 EU Universities and 4 Southern American (SA) academic institutions analyze critically the development of Kant scholarship in Southern America in the last 15 years, following the booming of Kant studies in that continent over that period and the exponential increase of its quality. Top SA Kant scholars are enrolled in the project that promises to enlarge greatly the competence of EU colleagues and in turn profit from their feedback. Early stage researchers from both ends also take part to the exchange. The consortium builds on a web of established relations of most of the participants, at the personal and institutional level.</objective>
