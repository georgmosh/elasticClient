two Cofund Programmes funded under FP7-PEOPLE-COFUND. The INdAM-DP-COFUND-2015 Programme plans to set up a new Doctoral
Programme in order to extend the range to incoming early stage researchers who intend obtain a PhD degree in Italy. The programme creates a large network of PhD schools in mathematics and/or applications and of non-academic partners, offering to the fellows a large and free choice of research topics, PhD projects, excellent research teams, transferable skills training, international, intersectoral, and interdisciplinary training. The Programme aims to reinforce the scientific excellence, the international dimension and the scientific attractiveness of Italy, by encouraging incoming excellent early stage researchers in mathematics and/or applications to obtain a PhD in Italy.The Programme consists of two Calls; its duration is 60 months; the total number of fellowship: 20; the total number of fellows-years: 60.</objective>
