  <objective>Located in Emilia Romana, EMMETI is a world leader in the field of palletization and depalletization thanks to its vast experience and the high quality standards of its machines. In the last 5 years, our sales figures have reached â‚¬ 30 million.
Established in 1976, and thanks to the huge investments made in the past, and with more planned in the future, EMMETI guarantees consistency of its high technological standards and the competitiveness of its products in a market that continues to demand higher performance. The majority of our quality work is based on long-term relationships with key customers who rely on our company to find solutions that provide added value to their products in terms of production processes. Our customers require our expertise to provide in-house research and having found some common direction, we wanted to find an effective unwrapping solution that would improve and speed-up production, reduce costs and guarantee safety at work stations. The result is our AUNPALL project, a novel machine which aims to automate the process of unpacking filmwrapped pallets in the packing line before its depalletization, in a rapid, reliable and safe way.</objective>
