  <objective>Laser systems are ubiquitous now, but advancing technology is always pushing the limits requiring smaller and more stable lasers. An optical microresonator is a tiny device that can act as a miniature compact optical reference system, enabling tighter frequency control in laser systems. This will enable the creation of compact narrow linewidth lasers in a variety wavelength ranges. Such systems are currently needed in a diverse array of market segments: timekeeping, LIDAR, gas sensing, oil well monitoring, and scientific laboratories. This proposal combines optical microresonators with microfabricated optical waveguide technology developed during the FET-Open iQUOEMS program to create a robustly packaged system that is resistant to strong temperature and vibrational perturbations.  The result will be successfully demonstrated prototype that will open up new markets for a start-up company being developed at EPFL.</objective>
