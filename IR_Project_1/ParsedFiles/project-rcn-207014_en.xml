Mobi’s charging infrastructure is easily scalable and uses onboard second-life EV batteries to create networks of grid-smart EV chargers. Mobi is capable of dual Level 2 and Level 3 Fast Charging, as is linked to a full-featured software platform. Each can add 60 km of range in half an hour. The mobility allows customers to avoid high infrastructure costs and underutilisation that plague traditional fixed charging stations, while also delivering a cost-effective solution to quickly scale up capacity. Deployments can be rolled out in days and EV drivers no longer have to waste time looking for an available charging station.</objective>
