  <objective>inteGRIDy aims to integrate cutting-edge technologies, solutions and mechanisms in a scalable Cross-Functional Platform connecting energy networks with diverse stakeholders, facilitating optimal and dynamic operation of the Distribution Grid (DG), fostering the stability and coordination of distributed energy resources and enabling collaborative storage schemes within an increasing share of renewables. 
inteGRIDy will: 
a) Integrate innovative smart grid technologies, enabling optimal and dynamic operation of the distribution system’s assets within high grid reliability and stability standards
b) Validate innovative Demand Response technologies and relevant business models
c) Utilize storage technologies and their capabilities to relieve the DG and enable significant avoidance of RES curtailment, enhancing self-consumption and net metering
d) Enable interconnection with transport and heat networks, forming Virtual Energy Network synergies ensuring energy security 
e) Provide modelling &amp; profiling extraction for network topology representation, innovative DR mechanisms and Storage characterization, facilitating decision making in DG’s operations
f) Provide predictive, forecasting tools &amp; scenario-based simulation, facilitating an innovative Operation Analysis Framework
g) Develop new business and services to create value for distribution domain stakeholders and end users/prosumers in an emerging electricity market.

inteGRIDy will impact on: 
a) operations by reconfigurable topology control &amp; supervision 
b) market by providing new services 
c) customer by enhanced engagement through DR mechanisms 
d) transmission by novel forecasting scenarios for the MV/LV areas 
e) part of the production incorporating innovative storage targeting the optimum use of RES
f) environment by CO2 reduction
inteGRIDy approach will be deployed and validated in 6 large-scale and 4 small-scale real-life demonstration covering different climatic zones and markets with different maturity.</objective>
