  <objective>Electric machines (generators and motors) are ubiquitous, the cornerstones of the modern world and the transition into a low-carbon economy. The impact of electrical machine’s performance on all aspects of energy, from cost-effectiveness to environmental footprint, cannot be overstated.  Most machines, however, are based induction motor + gearboxes combinations. These have limited efficiencies and poor reliability, making them unsuitable for applications in e.g. wind power turbines. More advanced direct drive (gearbox-less) machines suffer from cost, size, and efficiency limitations. Most current solutions do not provide a good fit to the requirements of advanced machine usage, where efficiency, mass, volume, reliability, cost-effectiveness, and volume production remain limitations.
Magnax is a Belgian startup team combining unique practical engineering and commercial start-up experience with world-class electric machine research. We have developed a unique, proprietary variant of axial flux direct drive machine, which can provide a step change in efficiency, size, reliability, manufacturing resource requirement, and cost-effectiveness. 
Magnax has developed a 100kW full-scale MVP prototype, which is undergoing testing in commercially viable prototype systems within micro-grid wind power solution. The proposed project will develop this concept further: scaling it to MW generators for use in offshore/utility wind power projects, and developing a high-speed motor (HS) version for use in demanding electric motor applications – such as electric vehicles. In phase 1, we will analyse these broader potential markets, and develop a roadmap to take the MW and HS products to market via validation in commercial trials (phase 2), and scaling to market (phase 3).</objective>
