  <acronym>CHANGE</acronym>
  <objective>The CHANGE project aims to foster collaboration between the public and researchers in Finland in order to improve our everyday life in a rapidly changing world. This project brings together 9 universities, 1 research institute and two expert organisations for science communication. It spans many facets of research in Finland and covers numerous individual researchers with diverse backgrounds and research topics. We will deliver a message of cutting edge research conducted in Finland and introduce the general public with the large number of researchers and the significant work they perform. We want to break stereotypes the general public may have on researchers. The programme for activities during the night will include content for everyone, from children to seniors. However, the specific aim is to promote research careers especially to high school and university students, and young people in general who are about to make their first real career choice. Our message is that high education is fun and could provide them with a secured future. For the first time, so many Finnish universities and organisations will unite for a widespread European Researchersâ€™ Night and perform simultaneously activities targeted for the general public around the country.</objective>
