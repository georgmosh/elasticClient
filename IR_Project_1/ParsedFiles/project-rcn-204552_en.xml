  <objective>This proof of concept is based on the ERC Advanced Grant TRAVERSE (2009-2015). It will exploit immersive virtual reality in a new form of psychological clinical intervention akin to Gestalt Therapy.  The primary aim of this Proof of Concept project is to generate a business model that would allow us to diffuse our technology to thousands of counsellors and psychologists around the world. In order to accomplish that we commission further trials to extend the evidence base of the approach, investigate through market research the extension of the technique for business practice, develop a commercial prototype with consumer equipment that would be low cost but high quality, exhibit our product at international conferences, and make the system available on loan to psychologists or counsellors who wished to try it, and generally start the process of diffusion. Moreover, we that our low cost system incorporates patentable inventions that would be investigated in an IP strategy. Through this approach we will develop the Business Model and a draft Business Plan for mass take up of our applications.</objective>
