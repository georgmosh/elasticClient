  <objective>This project addresses the problem of programming model design and implementation for the Exascale. The first Exascale computers will be very highly parallel systems, consisting of a hierarchy of architectural levels. To program such systems effectively and portably, programming APIs with efficient and robust implementations must be ready in the appropriate timescale. A single, “silver bullet” API which addresses all the architectural levels does not exist and seems very unlikely to emerge soon enough. We must therefore expect that using combinations of different APIs at different system levels will be the only practical solution in the short to medium term. Although there remains room for improvement in individual programming models and their implementations, the main challenges lie in interoperability between APIs. It is this interoperability, both at the specification level and at the implementation level, which this project seeks to address and to further the state of the art. INTERTWinE brings together the principal European organisations driving the evolution of programming models and their implementations. The project will focus on seven key programming APIs: MPI, GASPI, OpenMP, OmpSs, StarPU, QUARK and PaRSEC, each of which has a project partner with extensive experience in API design and implementation. Interoperability requirements, and evaluation of implementations will be driven by a set of kernels and applications, each of which has a project partner with a major role in their development. The project will implement a co- design cycle, by feeding back advances in API design and implementation into the applications and kernels, thereby driving new requirements and hence further advances.</objective>
