  <objective>The ProSurf project aims to enhance the surface functionalities of six demonstrator parts by using a wide range of high precision manufacturing technologies, such as diamond machining techniques, enabling the mass production of cost effective, structured parts with accurate replication technolo-gies, like micro injection moulding. By implementing these technologies to manufacture a variety of benefiting functionalities, it is critical to assess the parts quality in a safe and fast manner. Therefore, the ProSurf project incorporates the development of robust in-process metrology as well as the derivation of the surfacesâ€™ functions to three dimensional parameters for a fast measurement of functional relevant surface characteristics and specific function testing of the produced demonstrators. Due to the spectrum of surface functionalities linked to the part demonstrators and their varied application fields that range from optical to medical, ProSurf makes possible to reach a high impact on several areas of the society by, e.g. increasing the safety of medical procedures and the performance of moulds for ceramic injection moulding as well as cleaning rolls for electronic parts.</objective>
