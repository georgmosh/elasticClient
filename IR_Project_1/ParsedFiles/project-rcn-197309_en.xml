  <acronym>SupraChem Lab</acronym>
  <objective>The SupraChem Lab Project aims to set up a competitive research group in the field of hybrid materials for adaptive selforganized supramolecular structures, in “Petru Poni” Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry - IntelCentre, Iasi, Romania. The new created group will benefit of:
- the experience of Professor Jean Marie-Lehn (Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1987) who has accepted to supervise and support the set-up of the SupraChem Lab group and to chair the International Advisory Board of the Project
and
- the exceptional infrastructure of the newly built IntelCentre (Centre of Advanced Research in Bionanoconjugates and Biopolymers), 5 MEuro investition from the Structural Founds

Under the supervision of the ERA Chair the SupraChem Lab Group will unlock and foster the excellent research and innovation in PPIMC IntelCentre and will contribute to increase the European and international visibility of the Institute.</objective>
