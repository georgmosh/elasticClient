  <objective>Forest policy and decision makers are challenged by the need to balance the increasing demand for forest-based services (e.g. recreation, protection, conservation) and wood-based products (e.g. timber, fuelwood) with the foreseen scarcity of supply in different situations as for example disturbances (e.g. wildfires, droughts). Under these circumstances research on the impacts of different disturbances on the supply of services and goods is needed. To achieve these multipurpose forest managements and to integrate risk and uncertainty, New tools and models are needed. Furthermore, these tools and models may help to develop new policies that target the achievement of certain level of services while sustaining a certain level of goods supply. This project will take advantage of the knowledge on these topics in European and American organizations. It will further serve to exchange and generate knowledge on multipurpose forests, addressing risk and uncertainty as well as to strengthen research collaboration through active networking, staff exchange and dissemination activities between the participants.</objective>
