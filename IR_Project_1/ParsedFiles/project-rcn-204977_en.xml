  <objective>ELECTRIFIC will revolutionise how electric vehicles are integrated into power grid and usersâ€™ life. The fundamental premise on which the project will work that significant improvements to electromoblity can be unlocked by increasing coordination of all the actors in the electromobility ecosystem. To this end, the project will deliver novel techniques and ICT tools for enabling such coordination at all levels of the ecosystem. At the grid level, the project will develop new smart charging stations capable of dynamically controlling charging rate, maximizing the use of renewables and making as grid-friendly as possible. At level of EV users, the project will develop advanced driver assistance services that help and motivate the users plan travel and charging in a way that is convenient and yet respects potential constraints on charging capacity. Finally, at the EV fleet level, the project will develop management tools that help to optimise fleet operations, maximising battery lifetime and minimising charging costs. ELECTRIFIC comprises a balanced consortium of experienced research partners, energy providers and innovative electromobility SMEs. The results of the project will disseminated in the scientific community and rolled out to commercial use from e-bikes to e-buses, from private owners to government services and including cross-border mobility.</objective>
