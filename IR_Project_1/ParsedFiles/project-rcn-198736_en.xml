  <objective>The objective of the project is to enhance the innovation management capacity of Estonian SMEs. The action is aimed at
two kinds of SMEs - beneficiaries of the SME Instrument of Horizon and SMEs with significant innovation activities and a
high potential for internationalisation. For beneficiaries of the SME Instrument, the service package (the Key Account
Management service) consists of identifying weaknesses in the innovation capacities of the beneficiary; identifying suitable
coaches (based on the assessment in the first step) to address the identified weaknesses and moderating the coach-client
relationship; and accompanying the beneficiary through the SME Instrument project. The service packages outside the
scope of the SME Instrument (the “Enhancing the innovation management capacity of SME's” service) consist of carrying
out a diagnostic audit of the selected SMEs; and developing and implementing a tailored action plan to improve the SME’s
capacity to manage innovation processes.

Within the current action, the ESTINNO-NET consortium aims to provide the 7-day service packages to at least 15 SMEs.</objective>
