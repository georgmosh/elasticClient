  <acronym>TimePROSAMAT</acronym>
  <objective>"TimeProSAMAT aims to introduce concepts to program the time domain of self-assembled systems and materials in CLOSED systems under non-equilibrium conditions by controlling the kinetics of assembly and disassembly pathways via (i) modulating the surrounding by feedback systems, (ii) dissipative structure formation and (iii) active structural feedback. After reaching a fundamental understanding on a SA level, we want to capitalize on these enabling SA concepts by providing entirely new and original approaches to dynamic soft materials with internally encoded self-regulation features (similar to a self-destruction mechanism), opening doors to active functionalities and adaptive properties beyond what classical responsive equilibrium SA can offer.
