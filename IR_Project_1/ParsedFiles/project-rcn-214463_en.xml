  <objective>Lightweight carbon-fibre composites are now widely-used in the aerospace industry and contribute to a reduction of fuel consumption and carbon-footprints in air transportation. A similar penetration of carbon fibre composites in the automotive industry could lead to a reduction of 60 Mton of CO2 emissions per year. More recently, the emergence of functional nano composites is enabling polymers to replace metallic materials in areas where functionality such as high thermal or electrical conductivity is required. Much research to date to improve the structural and functional behaviour of composites has focussed on the fibres or nanoparticle while understanding the role of the matrix, which is necessary for any composite has been largely neglected. This Fellowship will adopt a resin-centred approach to understanding the processing, fabrication, and performance of polymer based composites. This Fellowship will demonstrate that by careful selection of appropriate matrix ‘ingredients’, significant performance improvements can be obtained. Furthermore, this Fellowship will link the molecular structure of a composite matrix directly to the observed in-service performance, paving the way for the bespoke design of resin for any conceivable application.</objective>
