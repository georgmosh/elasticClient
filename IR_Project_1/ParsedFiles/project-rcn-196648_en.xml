  <objective>FARINA PRESSE, 80 years old Italian SME specialized in High Tonnage Hot Forging Presses (HTHFP: &gt; 25.000 kN) with a solid R&amp;D tradition and a fame of excellence in hot forging sector, aims at developing a UNIVERSAL KIT, suitable to be installed on the most different types of existing HTHFPs, capable to reduce up to 30% their electric energy consumption and increase up to 33% their productivity, so that to address the potential of the European working HTHFPs' fleet and obtain an important energy consumption reduction at system level.
The European forging industry, an highly energy intensive sector, is steadly forced to reduce production costs and increase production volumes. The project will allow to meet the forging industry needs and its application on the European market will obtain significant energy saving on European energy networks. We estimate our kit will allow to save about 210 MWh/year for an average HTHFP, actually dissipated as unproductive heat: if extended to the European HTHFP fleet, it means a potential saving of 420 GWh/year, equivalent to a reduction of 210.000 tons CO2 emission per year.</objective>
  <title>Development of a universal kit to be installed on existing and new High Tonnage Hot ForgingPresses, for a potential strong reduction of energy consumption of the European installed fleet.</title>
