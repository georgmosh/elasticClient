  <acronym>FAMILIADOS</acronym>
  <objective>familiados.com is a marketplace on line where families can find, select and hire caregivers. Caregivers can create profiles,
showing education, specialization, experience and availability; they also choose their hourly rate and the area where they
want to work. Families, on their side, can search, find profiles with the specific skills for their need, request availability, close
the deal directly with the caregiver and rate the service.
All of it in an open platform, where familiados role is to facilitate the interaction, making sure that the profiles include true
information, that families can evaluate their experience and that the transactions take place in a seamless and fluid way,
from the beginning to the end, from selection to payment and evaluation.
The two main differential features of familiados are: (1) it specializes in care services for seniors, disabled people and
hospital companionship; and (2) it is focused in temporary needs, short term assignments.
And the way we will fundamentally change the way this market works now is: (i) by offering caregivers a tool to
professionalize their offer, allowing them to reach the market in a differentiated way and be seen as valuable professionals;
and (ii) by offering families the tool to select and choose a group of favourite caregivers to take care of their needs, ensuring
availability and the right professional for the right need.</objective>
