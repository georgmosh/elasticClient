  <objective>Mcule.com aims to provide the best web-based drug discovery platform for pharmaceutical researchers (big companies, contract research organisations and academics). We aim to create an easily searchable chemical database of 500 million purchasable compounds, the Ultimate database. The Ultimate database would be primarily based on virtual (not yet synthesized, but predicted to be synthesizable) compounds. Such a large chemical space would present a major advantage for pharma and biotech companies by increasing their chances to effectively identify novel compounds, reducing their costs and time losses. This development will increase our market share and promote our growth.</objective>
