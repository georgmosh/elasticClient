  <objective>Point-of-care biosensing technologies often suffer from low sensitivity, specificity, affordability and simplicity. Within "Nanozymes POC" we are exploiting a lateral flow immunoassay point-of-care technology supported from the ERC award "Naturale CG". Our paper-based point-of-care device comprises a lateral flow immunosorbent assay showing a sensitivity of 100pg/mL p24 detection and a 100-fold improvement in sensitivity following a catalytic development step involving platinum core-shell nanoparticles (PtNCs) called “nanozymes”. This technology detects p24 in spiked plasma pool at concentrations as low as 1 pg/mL and has enormous potential for detection of HIV at earlier stages soon after infection, amenable for use in low- and middle-income countries. Within this award, we are optimising the components and their stability and performing tests using clinically relevant samples and in the field. We are also exploring the expansion of this platform technology for its potential in detecting biomarkers for cancer. The commercial strategy performed within Nanozymes POC will support its translation potential, targeting that patients can receive more timely access to treatment options and  improve their quality of life.</objective>
