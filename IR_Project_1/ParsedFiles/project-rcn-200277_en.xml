  <objective>"In the "AMO-dance" project, the researcher, Dr. Elham Khosravi and the host supervisor, Prof. Angel Rubio, aim at deriving non-empirical history-dependent functionals for the time-dependent density functional theory to study the strong field dynamics of atoms and molecules. Furthermore, towards accounting for the electron-nuclear coupling and quantum features of the nuclear dynamics in molecules, AMO-dance proposes an in detail investigation of Kohn-Sham potentials of the multicomponent density functional theory. AMO-dance project will involve fundamental theory development, numerical implementation as well as application to real systems."</objective>
