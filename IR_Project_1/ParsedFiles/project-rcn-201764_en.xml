  <acronym>HydroKinetic-25</acronym>
  <objective>The HydroKinetic-25 is an innovative, hydro renewable energy device designed to harness low-carbon, reliable and affordable energy from riverine and estuarine environments. Unlike other established forms of hydro power, no height differential, or ‘head’ of water, is needed to generate adequate power from the flow of water. This avoids expensive and disruptive civil works. 

Due to its small size and ease of deployment and maintenance, this renewable energy device opens up huge new market opportunities in terms of river energy generation where it previously was not possible. 

As a company scaling quickly with growing global ambitions, DesignPro has a vision to bring this device to the marketplace and make a meaningful impact towards lowering carbon emissions and contributing towards improving the world's energy crisis.</objective>
  <title>Commercialization of a viable and proven HydroKinetic Turbine that will harness the power of the world's rivers, canals and estuaries in a sustainable, innovative and cost-effective way.</title>
