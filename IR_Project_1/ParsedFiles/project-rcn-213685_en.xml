  <objective>Healthcare accounts for approximately 10% of global gross domestic product. While the average life expectancy increases and some diseases are disappearing, other diseases raise. Cost of healthcare is a major economical challenge leading to unequal distribution of health benefits, which starts with the access to medical diagnosis. This situation and the new 
industrial revolution creates an opportunity to transform and innovate in the healthcare domain. 

MicroSpot is the first portable, low-cost, robotized scanner microscope that converts any smartphone into a high quality and intelligent microscopic image diagnostic system. MicroSpot is connected to a cloud ecosystem, capable of real time streaming and remote control and an artificial intelligence assistant for image analysis.

MicroSpot aims to replace the actual obsolete equipment and processes used in microscopic medical image diagnosis while revolutionizing current manufacturing methods. MicroSpot democratizes the access to clinical image diagnosis by creating a new generation of medical devices that reduces time, costs and distances bringing microscopic image diagnostics closer to the point of care.</objective>
