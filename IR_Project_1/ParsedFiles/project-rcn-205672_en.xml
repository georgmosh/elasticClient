  <acronym>9eGEN</acronym>
  <objective>Scope of this project (referred to as 9eGEN in the Technical and Administrative Section) is to develop a High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) Brushless/Generator up to TRL6 intended to be installed on Clean Sky Life Craft helicopter for demonstration in flight.
ASE S.p.A., an medium-sized Italian company that has been working in the Aerospace &amp; Defence Industry for over 60 years sharing the market with major International players, is the applicant and the only participant in this project. 
The company owns full capability to run 9EGEN in its whole activities and delivery needs, relying on robust know-how and experience in the development and manufacture of Electrical Power Generation Systems.
Integration, Performance, Efficiency and Reliability are not only the key features of the HVDC Brushless/Generator ASE is strongly committed to giving shape to, but they also perfectly meet the requirement for a modern Life Craft helicopter able to meet Clean Sky standards and the challenging demand for a more innovative Brushless/Generator for next generation platforms.</objective>
