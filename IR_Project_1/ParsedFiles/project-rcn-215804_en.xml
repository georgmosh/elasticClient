  <objective>The achievements of the space age are essential to modern society, but they come at an environmental cost. The vast majority of the more than 16000 tracked objects currently orbiting the Earth are space debris. Passive debris mitigation measures are insufficient for the stabilization of the debris environment. In this light, considerable effort is being devoted to develop active debris removal and on-orbit servicing. Dedicated high-performance CubeSat platforms with propulsion system could make on-orbit servicing missions more robust and cost efficient. High Î”v propulsion systems technology was long awaited in the CubeSat community, and the proposed research project will significantly advance this field with innovative frameworks for mission design and quantification. The chosen mission concepts will enable a fast response to the changes in overall mission parameters which is rather novel for the space industry, where such parameters are typically frozen at the beginning of the project.</objective>
