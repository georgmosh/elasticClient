  <objective>Companies IPI and VACUTEC as consortium under combined management, are well established with fast mass spectrometric process controll in inorganic chemistry. For organic chemical process control, analytics of existing mass spectrometry is too slow to allow for active on-line control action, which would improve economy, quality of products, and environmental protection. Field ionization, the mildest ionization method in mass spectrometry, leading to most simple and easy reading analytic results, is intended to come available with the new IPI Field Ion Quadrupol-Mass spectrometer, providing that speed and ease of analytical evaluation as required for on-line control on organic chemical processes.</objective>
