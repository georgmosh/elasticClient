  <objective>European public entities are responsible of the provision of critical services like healthcare, education, justice, etc. In order to improve the delivery of their services to citizens over time they need to incorporate innovation. This innovation is often developed and produced by the private sector, for example in the form of technology.
A standard model of incorporating innovation is through technology-push: private suppliers develop their innovative solutions, with limited contact and exchange with the public entities, and then try to commercialize them. This limited contact often leads to solutions that are not completely tailored or addressing a profitable need, as there is no real engagement in collaborative relations with the public administration. This sub-optimal interaction and knowledge of the customer needs and culture, leave start-ups and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with un-marketable products, discouraging them to fully engage with an important market (Public Procurement in Europe is estimated at â‚¬2 trillion, close to 20% of EU GDP ).</objective>
