  <objective>Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) are critical players in mucosal defense, tissue homeostasis and inflammation. ILC2 development and function have been widely perceived to be programmed. Nevertheless, how ILC2 perceive, integrate and respond to environmental cues remains mostly unexplored. Here we hypothesize that ILC2 sense their environment and exert their function as part of a novel neuronal-ILC2 unit orchestrated by neuromedin U (NmU) signaling.
We propose to employ genetic, cellular and molecular approaches to decipher how NmU and its receptor Neuromedin Receptor 1 (Nmu-R1) set ILC2 function and preserve tissue homeostasis at mucosal barriers. To this end, ILC2-specific loss and gain of function mutant mice for Nmu-R1 will be used. Strikingly, preliminary data demonstrate that NmU is a major regulator driving ILC2 cytokine production. 
Under this Marie-Curie fellowship, we aim to establish a novel molecular interplay between neuron derived peptides and ILC2 function in mucosal homeostasis. Finally, this proposal will reveal new pathways with potential therapeutic value in mucosal disorders that are major public health concerns.</objective>
