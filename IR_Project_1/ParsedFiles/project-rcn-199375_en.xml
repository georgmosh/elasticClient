  <objective>The objective of this proposal is to explore the business cases for the implementation of GreenFluxâ€™s Service &amp; Operations Platform for  Smart Charging (GSOP-SC) in several European urban areas. This will contribute to the introduction of a full service and independent software solution, connectable with any (PH)EV charge protocol, that enables any EV to plug into any electricity grid in Europe, and provide an efficient platform for EV transaction and energy management. Such a platform will facilitate a complete chain optimization, from EV user to network operator, offering excellent commercial prospects.</objective>
