  <acronym>SheepNet</acronym>
  <objective>"SheepNet is a thematic network project about practice-driven innovation to improve sheep productivity (number of lambs weaned/ewe mated): a critical component of farmers’ income and therefore of the sustainability and attractiveness of sheep farming. SheepNet will establish durable exchange of scientific and practical knowledge among researchers, farmers and advisors, through a multi-actor and transdisciplinary approach at national and international levels and by the broad involvement of European Agriculture knowledge and Innovation Systems. This will promote the implementation and dissemination of innovative and best technologies and practices for the improvement of sheep productivity. To maximize impact and ensure a wide coverage of different farming systems, SheepNet will bring together six main sheep producing EU countries, plus Turkey, and Australia, New Zealand, and every relevant EU network.
The project aims to:
•         produce a scientific, technical and practical knowledge reservoir through a combined ""top-down and bottom-up"" approach and the strong involvement of 45 innovative farms; 
•         foster cross-fertilization through multi-actors workshops at national and international levels, a broad and interactive participation of the ""sheep community"" via social networks and an interactive platform;
•         develop an easily understandable support package of communication and learning material, web-based tools, interactive platform, designed to help both scientists and stakeholders and a strong interactions with the EIP AGRI Service Point will guarantee long-lasting and wide accessibility of the SheepNet results."</objective>
