  <objective>Design and manufacturing of an economical lightweight, safe and flight worthy canopy structure optimised for low aerodynamic drag, best field of view and in accordance with CS 29 requirements regarding bird strike capabilities for the high speed LifeRCraft.

Low weight design is intrinsically assured through the application of the innovative one-shot design of the canopy as a hollow single piece CFRP structure. 

The chosen tooling concept allows the manufacturing of the prototype as well as a low series production. 

Know how transfer from the automotive sector, mainly motorsport, is assured. The applicants have an excellent record in maintaining even the tightest schedules and delivering highest quality products on time and on budget.</objective>
