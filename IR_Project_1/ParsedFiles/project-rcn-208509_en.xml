  <objective>A PhD level candidate with expertise in computational imaging and image processing is sought by TSD to integrate and optimise the performance of a metrology instrument being developed for the inspection of transparent and turbid micro-devices. The skills of the candidate will be critical in reaching the goals of inspection rate and of adaptability of the instrument to tailored specifications required for a successful introduction to the market. The  kills of the candidate will complement the optical and mechanical engineering skills set existing within TSD, giving the candidate great opportunities of personal development into high end metrology instrument development.</objective>
