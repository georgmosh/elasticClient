  <objective>SySTEM 2020 will focus on science learning outside the classroom, mapping the field across Europe, evaluating a number of transdisciplinary programmes to design best principles for educators in this field, and also examining individual learning ecologies by piloting self-evaluation tools for learners which will document science learning outside of the classroom. This study will map practices in 19 EU countries, including in-depth studies in 8 of these countries, covering learners between 9 - 20 years from various backgrounds including those from geographically remote, socio-economically disadvantaged, minority and/or migrant communities.</objective>
