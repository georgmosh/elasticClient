  <objective>The objective of GALNIMBUS is to improve irrigation-water use efficiency up to 30% by developing a cloud-based irrigation controller able to perfectly match irrigation and fertigation doses to crop needs.
The system in order to perform detailed real-time forecasts for crop water requirements
-Defines irrigation needs based on crop specific data bases 
-Analyses real time data from the field (soil moisture, solar radiation, pH, plant stress, etc ) to evaluate crop status. 
-Checks online weather forecasts to readjust irrigation doses
-Satellite images 
Thanks to GALNIMBUS irrigation tasks are fully automatized, and the grower can monitor the crop or activate irrigation valves remotely anywhere at anytime.</objective>
