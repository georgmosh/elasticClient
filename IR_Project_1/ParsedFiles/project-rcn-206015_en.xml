  <objective>This project NEAR2050 will analyse and take in to account developing technologies, new societal trends, and changing demographics among others in order to obtain a full account of what users currently need and expect from the rail sector and what they will need and expect from the rail sector based on mega trend based scenarios in 2022,2030 and 2050.
NEAR2050 will analyse the entire process that needs to be gone through by both passengers and freight. This will look at the door-to-door offers as well as what planning options exist for customers. 
Investigations will be carried out as to what can be put in place to overcome the obstacles uncovered in the previous stage. These will range from “quick wins” and easy to implement ideas, to long term plans that require investment over numerous years.
Using the future needs determined over the course of this project, NEAR2050 will look at what each of the actors can implement how difficult implementation will be, and will make recommendations of implementation plans.
NEAR2050 will look at other mobility modes, make a determination of their development over the time scenarios and with that make a determination as to the type of cooperation that will be required and how this can be implemented. This can include interaction with busses, shared and private bikes, shared and private cars. The analyses will look at the opportunities of shared ticketing, booking, and pricing systems, and the availability of these mobility modes among others.</objective>
