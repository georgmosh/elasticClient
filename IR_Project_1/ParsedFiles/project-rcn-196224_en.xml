  <objective>Feasibility Study for the Development of a PFC Harmonic Filter
The Missing Link for Creation of Simultaneous Multi-Point Fast Charging Stations for Electric Vehicles Whilst some manufacturers offer “multi-vehicle” charge points, all models investigated were found to be cosmetic combinations of plural charging points capable of charging multiple vehicles operating the same charging methodology. No instances of true multi vehicle chargers (ie many types of vehicle/charging system on charge at the same time) were found.
This is due to the complexities arising around electrical harmonic interactions between vehicles under charge and the various charging methodologies. Sufficient work to define these has not been carried out and no vehicle or charger unit impact data is available over the longer term. Potential service providers face a choice between cosmetic combinations or multiple different charging stations, a costly option, low in flexibility.
The MultiCharge project will deliver a comprehensive picture of the harmonics between different vehicles and charging methodologies, before using software modelling to analyse the interactions and develop a Harmonic Filter to enable true multi-vehicle charging. MultiCharge replaces the active electronic module and multiple transformers present in most current EV chargers, with a single 3 phase 440 volt main passive unit comprising a zigzag auto transformer, harmonic filter, interphase transformer &amp; rectifier block and distribution bus &amp; control unit.
The project will deliver social and economic growth via increased uptake of cleaner to run, cheaper to use Electric Vehicles.
We will achieve this through delivery of an affordable re-charging system based upon market leader Carroll &amp; Meynell's own technology, patented buck boost units and zigzag transformer to enable significant reductions in the cost of providing appropriate electricity supply to EV charging stations.</objective>
