  <objective>The main objective of the EnerGAware project is to achieve a 15-30% energy consumption and emissions reduction in a social housing pilot and increase the social tenants’ understanding and engagement in energy efficiency. 

The EnerGAware project will develop and test, in publically owned social housing, a serious game that will be linked to the actual energy consumption (smart meter data) of the game user’s home and embedded in social media and networking tools. The solution fits within all three ICT areas suggested in the topic EE-11 scope: gaming, social networking and personalised data driven applications. 

The EnerGAware solution will provide an innovative IT ecosystem in which users can design their own virtual home and Avatar and learn about the potential energy savings from installing energy-efficiency measures and changing user behaviour, whilst maintaining the comfort of their Avatar. The user will need to learn to balance the energy consumption, comfort and financial cost of their actions. Energy savings achieved both virtually in the game, calculated by building performance simulation, and in reality, in the users’ actual homes, measured through smart meter data, will enable progression in the serious game. The social media features will provide users a platform to share data of their achievements, compete with each other, give energy advice, as well as, join together to form virtual energy communities.

The EnerGAware solution will be developed and deployed with the ‘cleanweb’ philosophy in mind: “Capital light, Quick to market and Quick to scale”, therefore the EnerGAware project will aim to go beyond just testing in a social housing pilot, but will seek commercial exploitation of the solution at the end of the project, through our industrial partners, in particular EDF Energy, a global energy provider, with 38 million European energy customers.</objective>
