  <objective>Biometrics is becoming increasingly popular to allow secure and passwordless authentication. The conventional fingerprint sensors currently in use are basically low-cost products mainly targeting mobile applications, such as smartphones and tablets. Due to security problems (easy to spoof), they do not meet the end-user requirements when true security and strong authentication is needed. Because ultrasound waves easily travel inside matter, a fingerprint sensor based on ultrasound provides significantly more secure authentication as it is able to capture 3D features. Ultrasound sensor is as convenient to use as other competing fingerprint sensors. Thus far, full benefits of ultrasound technology have not yet been used to meet the all end-user needs. MODULEUS will exploit technological advantages of ultrasound to address end-user needs related to high security confidence, usage convenience and privacy safeguard. The SME Phase 1 project will focus on security sector with the main objective to conceive comprehensive business plan with a strong go-to market strategy to facilitate the market expansion to high-volume markets.</objective>
