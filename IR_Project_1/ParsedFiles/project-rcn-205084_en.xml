  <objective>Greenely is a mobile application that provides a visual representation of energy usage, translating raw energy data from smart meters into algorithmic visuals of consumption patterns by hour, day or month; promoting sustainable energy consumption through behavioural data analysis and gamification. 
Energy Behaviour Gamified: In the last few years, more than 100 million smart meters have been installed in the EU, enabling energy data analysis for energy efficiency, allowing households to access new information to understand their consumption. 
Greenely is an IT SME disrupting energy efficiency by innovating sustainable energy practices by consumers in the retail market, bringing long-overdue technological advances to the power sector, and valuable data on energy behaviour to researchers. Without Greenely, households are often requested to pay electricity companies to access analysis of their energy consumption data by buying and installing a specific type of hardware to monitor consumption. Greenely is free for consumers and has developed algorithms that can translate the raw energy data and present it in a modern way that is available at any time. 
This feasibility study will address the users, technology, market, IPR, commercialisation strategy, and partners/stakeholders.</objective>
