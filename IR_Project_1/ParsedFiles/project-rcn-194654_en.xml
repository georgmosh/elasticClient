  <objective>The project objective is to provide a low-cost and fast service for test and evaluation of technology devices in outer space. The most outstanding added value of this proposal is to bring the space sector closer to technology developers through the standardization of the payload integration. 

The rate of production of new components and technologies in the European space industry is currently not accomplished to the availability of opportunities for in-orbit testing. European space industry needs to increase rapidly the maturity level of these components, in order not to lose the leading position in terms of technological competitiveness and innovation. This situation brings the commercial opportunity for a low cost and time effective service to evaluate new technologies in space environment, providing a multiple payload integration service to gain heritage as fast as the industry is demanding at present.

This innovative business opportunity, called Multi-Payload Satellite (MPSAT), is focused on achieving a new concept of space mission based on small satellites for in-orbit demonstration. The proposed project will develop a feasible and flexible service, drastically increasing the availability of opportunities for in-orbit testing for the whole technology developersâ€™ community. 

The proposal concept mimics a previous successful initiative known as Multi-project Chip Wafer (MPW). MPW is a foundry service in microelectronics, where the share of the non-recurrent costs involved in the manufacturing of several integrated circuits on a single run drastically reduces its price. In this way, MPSAT service offers flight opportunities to the technology developers without resources for managing their own mission, offering dedicated payload slots and including all the mission steps as a unique kit: Mission management, platform assembly, payloads integration, operational and environmental tests, launch, and in-orbit experiment evaluation services.</objective>
