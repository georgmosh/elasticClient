  <objective>This ESPResSo-project aims to bring the novel emerging hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite-based solar cell (PSC) technology to its next maturity level. In recent years (see Figure 1), this solution-processable solar technology has reached cell efficiency values rivalling those of established thin-film photovoltaic (PV) technology (CIGS, CdTe), even approaching crystalline Si (c-Si) records. The challenge is now to transfer this unprecedented progress from its cell level into a scalable, stable, low-cost technology on module level.
The consortium brought together here has alternative materials, insights in novel cell concepts and architectures, and the processing know-how and equipment at hand to overcome these barriers and realize following global objective: 
Demonstrate a highly efficient (&gt;17%) perovskite-based 35x35cm² module architecture that shows long-term (&gt;20 years) reliable performance as deduced from IEC-compliant test conditions. This module is to be produced with industry-relevant low CAPEX manufacturing techniques validating a potential electricity cost as low as 0.05€/kWh in Southern Europe. Installing an actual building-integrated facade element will validate the potential contribution of this technology to the future European energy supply system. Additionally, prototyping advanced, arbitrary-shaped module architectures with specific materials and process combinations will emphasize that new highly innovative applications like on flexible substrates or with high semi-transparency are well accessible on mid- to longer-term with this very promising thin-film PV technology.</objective>
