  <objective>The NextBase project, involving 8 research institutions and 6 companies, deals with the development of innovative high-performance c-Si solar cells and modules based on the interdigitated back-contacted silicon heterojunction (IBC-SHJ) solar cell concept targeting cells with efficiency above 26.0% and corresponding solar modules with efficiency above 22.0%. In particular, a number of new design and process innovations throughout the wafer, cell and module fabrication that go beyond the state-of-the-art will be introduced into the device to achieve the targeted efficiency values. At the same time, the NextBase project pursues the development of a new industrial manufacturing tool and low-cost processes for the IBC-SHJ solar cells enabling a competitive IBC-SHJ solar module cost of &lt; 0.35 â‚¬/Wp.</objective>
