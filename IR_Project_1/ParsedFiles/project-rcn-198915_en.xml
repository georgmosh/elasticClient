  <objective>Batteries are the key element of hybrid vehicles (HEV) and they are responsible for the technical and economic performance of HEVs, the main problem and therefore also the greatest technological challenge.
We have already developed LIFE-BATTERY, a new prototype of NiM-H battery able to carry out 2,000 charge/discharge cycles representing an increase of four times in the battery lifespan. As a consequence, the cost per kilometer is six times cheaper compared to current batteries.</objective>
