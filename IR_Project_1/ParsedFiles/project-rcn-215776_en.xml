  <acronym>FSI in hadron decays</acronym>
  <objective>The precision study of complex multibody decays of bottom and charm hadrons has unique sensitivity to new fundamental particles and interactions that could give rise to the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe, or dark matter. New, vast datasets allow for these studies to be performed with unprecedented experimental precision. However, theoretical uncertainties limit the sensitivity of this approach. The proposed research overcomes this limitation by developing novel theoretical tools to describe multibody hadron decays, and applying them to the latest datasets in a unique collaboration between theory and experiment.

In particularly, this research program focus on improving particles strong interaction description in the final states of multibody decays (B--&gt;KKK, B--&gt; Kππ, B--&gt;K*μμ and Bc--&gt;KKπ), including both low-energy two-body full amplitudes, with rescattering and coupled channels; and hight-energy charm mesons as intermediate states of the process.</objective>
