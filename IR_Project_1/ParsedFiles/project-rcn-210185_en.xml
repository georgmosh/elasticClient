  <objective>SERA is the "Seismology and Earthquake Engineering Research Infrastructure Alliance for Europe", responding to the priorities identified in the call INFRAIA-01-2016-2017 Research Infrastructure for Earthquake Hazard.
The overall objective of SERA is to give a significant contribution to improve the access to data, services and research infrastructures, and deliver solutions based on innovative R&amp;D in seismology and earthquake engineering, aiming at reducing the exposure of our society to the risk posed by natural and anthropogenic earthquakes.
To this end, SERA will: Involve the communities involved in previous successful projects including NERA and SERIES; Offer transnational access to the largest collection of high-class experimental facilities in earthquake engineering; Offer virtual access to the main data and products in seismology and anthropogenic seismicity; Promote multi-disciplinary science across the domains of seismology, anthropogenic seismicity, near-fault observatories and deep underground laboratories, to achieve an improved understanding of earthquake occurrence; Revise the European Seismic Hazard reference model for consideration in the ongoing revision of the Eurocode 8; Develop the first comprehensive framework for seismic risk modeling at European scale; Develop the new standards for future experimental observations in earthquake engineering and for the design of future instruments and networks for observational seismology; Develop reliable methodologies for real-time assessment of shaking and damage; Expand access to seismological observations; Network infrastructures and communities in the fields of deep seismic sounding, experimental earthquake engineering and site characterization; Provide an important contribution to the construction and validation of EPOS; Provide effective communication and outreach to all stakeholders.</objective>
