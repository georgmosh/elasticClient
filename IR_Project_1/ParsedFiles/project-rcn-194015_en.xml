  <objective>"The action “Establishing services enhancing the innovation management capacity of SME's in the Enterprise Europe Network"" represents an important breakthrough in delivering the EEN services. Until now the EEN consortia partners’ role was mainly catalyzing the SMEs innovation needs with the innovative product, services and processes provided by other companies or research centres, with the aim of fostering their  internationalization.
Strengthening the target of internationalization, with the New Action, the EEN consortia partners will improve their action providing  on site support to SMEs, and becoming a part of the companies for assessing their capacity in the innovation management issues. The SCRIPT consortium as a whole is able to provide the expected services:

• Support companies in the project management and administration

Enhancing SME innovation management capacity
