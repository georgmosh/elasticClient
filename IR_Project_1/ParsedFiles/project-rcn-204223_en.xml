  <acronym>BRIGHT</acronym>
  <objective>The BRIGHT project aims at enhancing the visibility and perception of researchers among the general population in the Tuscany Region, simultaneously with all the European  Researchers’ Night (ERN) initiatives.
BRIGHT acronym means “Brilliant Researchers Impact on Growth Health and Trust in research”, wishing to underline the positive aspect of the research activity in order to convey a positive message to the general public.
BRIGHT is planned in for two years - i.e. two events, one in 2016 and another in 2017 - and livens up not only two “nights” with entertaining and exciting events spread across the main Tuscany cities,  but it also creates a lot of initiatives aiming at building permanent “Research Urban Trekking” paths leading towards the complete awareness of the researcher’s role in society. “Researchers make your life better!” is the guiding principle stemming from the passion, the enthusiasm and hard intellectual work of researchers’ daily work and how this contributes to the well-being of the general population. BRIGHT focuses on creating awareness on the important role played by researchers in addressing the great challenges ahead, such as health and wellbeing, new technologies, sustainable development, physical and biological challenges, cultural heritage.
BRIGHT will be successful if it will be able to convince the population of the IMPACT of the researchers and the research's products for the development of the society, and to make people TRUST the researchers instead of being driven away by hoaxes with no scientific basis.</objective>
