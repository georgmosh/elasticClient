The partnerships will be instrumental in addressing, therefore, the following specific objectives:
Specific Objective 1) Consolidating of a joint international scientific and innovation programme for developing research projects on DoC diagnosis, evaluation and management of patients.
Specific Objective 2) Establishing a standardised methodology, common approach and data sharing resources to enable data access and research collaborations concerning DoC. 
Specific Objective 3) Contributing to transfer of knowledge and quality of life of the individuals, by generating new services, technologies and/or products to respond to the society needs concerning DoC. 
In short, this action will increase the scientific competence of the consortium members at the international level in DoC research and clinical practice, enhancing the transfer of knowledge and professional skills on evidence-based interventions and validated technology for a better management of patients. 
To reach the mentioned goal, the partnership is composed by ten partners from different countries in Europe (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, and Spain), covering a wide range of expertise, and bringing together academic and non-academic entities.</objective>
