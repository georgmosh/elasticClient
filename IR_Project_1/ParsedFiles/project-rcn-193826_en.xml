  <objective>The objective of the UKRAINE project, in line with GALILEO-3-2014 Call, are to foster application development through international cooperation and to create a broad acceptance of EGNSS in Ukraine, creating at the same time opportunities both for knowledge building and at commercial level. The contribution of the UKRAINE project with respect to the aforementioned objectives relates to the achievement of the following impacts:
- preparation of the Ukrainian aviation market to the extension of EGNOS
- support to the uptake of regulated EGNSS applications through the elaboration of a legislative roadmap
- generation of innovative solutions for multimodal logistics and dangerous goods
- creation of business matchmaking opportunities for Ukrainian and EU companies

These impacts will be achived by a set of coordinated actions:
1. performing a study on integrating the Ukrainian legal framework to key European directives and regulations on EGNSS transport
2. working on aviation as the starting point for the extension of EGNOS to Ukraine, by a) preparing the ground for LPV procedures, b) working on GNSS signal monitoring and c) setting the required legal framework
3. innovating in the field of EGNSS tracking and tracing of Dangerous Goods and performing a pilot on multimodal freight transport
4. creating business matchmaking opportunities between EU and Ukrainian companies and engaging GNSS stakeholders through a contest on a multiconstellation receiver
5. disseminating results through pilots, demonstrators and an extensive communication campaign

The maximum possible involvement of Ukrainian stakeholders will be ensured by a) the direct involvement of the State Space Agency of Ukraine, the National Aviation University and the Technical Polytechnic of Kiev (KPI), b) the organization of events, matchmaking opportunities and contests targeting Ukrainian entities and c) the vision to release products on the Ukrainian market</objective>
