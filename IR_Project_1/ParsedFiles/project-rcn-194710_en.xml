  <objective>ONCOVISION is a Spanish SME specialised in design, development, production and commercialisation of organ-dedicated PET systems. Our company submits the present innovation project with the overall objectives of marketing an innovative brain-dedicated PET system to early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) based on the detection of β-amyloid biomarker in the brain using two 18F-labelled tracers recently approved by FDA and EMEA for their clinical use and a validation of the clinical performance of this new diagnostic device.
This new brain-dedicated PET system, targeted to Mental Disorder Units and Nuclear Medicine Units of hospitals in Europe, USA and Japan; is unique in the market and offers several advantages compared to the whole-body PET systems such as higher resolution, three times higher sensibility, a competitive price (up to three times lower), needs smaller hospital facilities, lower radiotracer dose to the patient that leads to a lesser cost to the healthcare system. Due to this improved characteristics, the new brain-dedicated PET system will help to allow an early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and other causes of cognitive decline and to use this business opportunity to ensure profitability and growth of ONCOVISION. 
During Phase 1, a technical/economic feasibility study is envisaged to verify the viability of the product and its clinical validation. In Phase 2, the validation of clinical performance of the product will be carried out, to enable commercialisation in Phase 3.</objective>
