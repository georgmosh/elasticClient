  <objective>PENTABIOL has developed and tested PROBISAN, a fermented fodder improver for nutrition of animals that overtakes the
performance of any other fodder improver on the market. The most strict and unbiased product test has been undertaken on
a single commercial swine farm in Spain comparing PROBISAN and the leading product on the market. Each product was
used to feed during the same period of a population of 1.575 piglets (252 each fodder). PROBISAN piglets ate 10% less and
grew 4% more than competition piglets. Considering both effects PROBISAN offers 14% more yield than the best product on
the market. Furthermore the average deviation of results with the group of 7 independent tests showed that PROBISAN is
much more stable than the other fodders.</objective>
