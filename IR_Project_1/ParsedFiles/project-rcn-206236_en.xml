  <objective>WiseGRID has two intertwined and equally important strategic goals: on the one hand, it aims at successfully putting in the market, within a horizon of 24 months after project completion, a set of solutions and technologies which increase the smartness, stability and security of an open, consumer-centric European energy grid, with an enhanced use of storage technologies and a highly increased share of RES. On the other hand, the project intends to have a significant impact in the business and innovation activities of the consortium -with a planned ROI for the partners of less than 30 months after commercialisation of WiseGRID products and services starts- and the European sector at large, contributing to the creation of jobs, the access to new energy services of citizens and public/private organisations, the saving of CO2, and the increase of of RES, among other impacts.
The achievement of these strategic goals will involve the four aspects addressed by LCE-02-2016: (a) Demand Response, (b) Smartening the Distribution Grid, (c) Demonstrating Energy Storage Technologies and (d) the Smart Integration of Grid Users from Transport. 
WiseGRID technologies and solutions will be packed within 9 different products, the impact of  which will be demonstrated under real life conditions in 4 large scale demonstrators â€“in Belgium, Italy, Spain and Greece-. In order to facilitate the assessment of the performance, transferability and scalability of these solutions, the demonstrations will be conducted following 7 high level use cases.</objective>
