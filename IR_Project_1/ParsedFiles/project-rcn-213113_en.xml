  <objective>A photonics driven breakthrough in image quality and functionality of an interventional X-ray system will allow to perform stroke diagnosis directly in the treatment suite and have a huge impact: enhanced work flow, reduced diagnosis &amp; treatment time (up to 50% time reduction) which will save peopleâ€™s life and reduce healthcare costs.
NEXIS will establish enhanced contrast Cone Beam CT imaging while keeping high spatial resolution for 2D image guidance by an innovative spectral X-ray detector and related image processing (including deep learning). Two new key photonic components will be developed: 1) A thin foil based image sensor which has a (semi-) transparent TFT backplane, so that the photodiode array can receive light from both the top and the bottom side. This (semi-) transparency will be optimised, so that the image sensor can collect light effectively from top and bottom scintillator layers at the same time. 2) A 3D printed pixelated CT-like scintillator with high spatial and temporal resolution to enable fast Cone Beam CT imaging without image artefacts. The usability and applicability of the new spectral NEXIS X-ray system for stroke imaging will be clinically validated in a European top hospital. The project brings together a multidisciplinary consortium, involving the full value chain (photonics R&amp;D, medical system integrator, application owner, supply chain and equipment manufacturing). It will allow key players in the European medical photonics industry to generate sales and stay competitive by providing new X-ray imaging modalities and EU based manufacturing. NEXIS will strengthen European competitiveness by developing a spectral Detector-on-Foil technology that meets the needs of the European and global X-ray image detectors market. NEXIS initiate the transition of standard (black&amp;white) to spectral (colour) X-ray detectors, which will improve performance and functionality of X-ray imaging systems.</objective>
