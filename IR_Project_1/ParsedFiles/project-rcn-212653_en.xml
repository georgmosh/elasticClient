  <objective>We look for new physics in events with top quarks using LHC proton-proton collisions at the CMS detector. A direct search for top quark partners in the form of vector-like quarks is performed, complemented by an indirect but model-independent search for new physics interacting with top quarks using precision top quark properties measurements. In order to enable these and similar analyses to continue at the future High Luminosity LHC, we study the performance of the upgraded track trigger for events with top quarks, including optimisation of reconstruction algorithms and working points.</objective>
