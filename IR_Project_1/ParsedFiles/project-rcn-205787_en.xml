  <acronym>OPTIFUEL</acronym>
  <objective>The goal is to realize the global market opportunity related to a disruptive real-time solid biofuels quality control and optimization solution created, tested and proven by INRAY Ltd in cooperation with industrial anchor customers since 2009. The innovation enables biomass power plants to replace the current manual sampling method by real-time assessment and optimization of fuel handling and combustion, producing concrete value and savings both to a vast body of industrial customers and the society at large. 

For the entire EU’s bioenergy production, the OPTIFUEL solution could produce 1.5 Billion Euros in annual savings and decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 0,5-3,0 Million tons. OPTIFUEL also enables more effective use of local low quality biofuels, which would increase EU’s self-sufficiency in biofuels. For a mid-size biomass power plant, OPTIFUEL produces up-to 1 Million Euros in annual savings.</objective>
