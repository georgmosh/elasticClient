  <objective>EKOservis Membrane Modular Filtration System

The intention of the innovation project itself is to solve the technological system of wastewater treatment using flat sheet membranes to achieve a high degree of cleaning. The project focuses on municipal and industrial sewage treatment plants meeting the requirements of Directive 76/160/EEC concerning the quality of bathing water.

The project contributes to the protection of water and water resources, to the re-use of waste water, and to the improvement of water quality in watercourses and reservoirs. The project provides advanced solutions for water purification and its further use in a sustainable manner.

The aim of the innovation project is to introduce a process of membrane filtration into practice. We want to show that the opportunities for use of membrane filtration are wide - ranging from a single family house to the water treatment plants with a capacity of more than 50,000 m3 of purified waste water per day, which are intended for cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants.</objective>
