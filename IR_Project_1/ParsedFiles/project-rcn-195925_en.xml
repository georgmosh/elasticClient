  <objective>This project will develop a new, highly enantioselective, state-of-the-art synthetic route to the daphniyunnine family of alkaloids based on a novel dual organo / metal catalysed desymmetrization reaction of alkene-linked cyclohexanones as a key step, which will allow the rapid and efficient construction of the AB rings ready for subsequent advancement to the majority of the family members. Evaluation of the anti-cancer biological activity of the different target molecules and late stage intermediates will be carried out. This Fellowship project combines total synthesis, new asymmetric methodology development and biological evaluation. It has been designed to augment and complement the research and transferable skills sets of the Marie Curie fellow, Dr Sonawane, and will greatly enhance his career prospects accordingly. Through the training and the research results arising, the Fellowship will be beneficial to the fellow, the host institution and European science.</objective>
