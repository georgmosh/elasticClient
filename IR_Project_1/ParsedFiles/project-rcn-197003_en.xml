  <acronym>OKIDOKEYS</acronym>
  <objective>OKIDOKEYS is a new system to unlock your home or garage door by using a smartphone or other several devices. The system will allow the user to install it in a few minutes with no need of changing the door lock.
The system interacts with both an Okidokeys app-enabled smartphone (iOS and Android) as well as a number of different fobs. As an alternative to smartphones e-key, OpenWays also offers keyfobs, walletcard-tags and wristband-tags.
Okidokeys has recently started a market test in the USA with very good acceptance; the objective of this project is to validate and demonstrate the new system for the European requirements that will require getting over several challenges.
In the last 50 years the lock / key industry has not innovated very much:
- Using metal keys could cause problems if they are lost
- Metal keys are difficult to dispatch, remove or cancel.
- Metal keys have limited security
- Metal keys are expensive. (New securing locks have more expensive keys)
Okidokeys will eliminate all those problems by the use of smart keys “installed” in a smart-phone, cell-phone, keychain, wristband, walletcard tags integrating Bluetooth 4.0, CAC (Crypto Acoustic Credentials), RFID and NFC technologies.</objective>
