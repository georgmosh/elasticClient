  <objective>The goal of the TASPPI European Training Network (ETN) is the establishment of a highly interdisciplinary research and educational training platform for early stage scientists in the Chemical Life Sciences to overcome the inherent boundaries between academia and industry and to increase their employability in both areas. To this end we have teamed up in a consortium comprising 5 partners from industry (AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, UCB, Lead Disocvery Center, Taros Chemicals) and 6 partners from academia (Universities of Dundee, Eindhoven, Leeds, Lille, Prague, and Siena). The scientific objective of the multi-sectorial Training Network is the development and implementation of a multidisciplinary technology platform bringing together structural molecular biology, chemical biology, cell biology, synthetic chemistry, and medicinal chemistry for the identification of Small-molecule Stabilizers of Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) as a novel class of therapeutic agents and basic research tool compounds. With this new technological approach we aim to address a number of unmet medical needs in the areas Cancer, Neurodegenerative Diseases (Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s), Pulmonary Diseases, Inflammation and Metabolic Diseases (Diabetes).</objective>
