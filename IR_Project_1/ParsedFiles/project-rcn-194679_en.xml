  <objective>The Smart Actuator Company Ltd develops smart, RIFT Driven® actuators our first was delivered to market in Q3-2013.  The system is proven to use 25% less copper, be 80% lighter and 75% more energy efficient than our competitors.  Early success means that the first two years production scheduling is already sold to 90% capacity and The Smart Actuator Company now own global rights for the use of RIFT Technology in electrically powered actuators.  Put simply, we believe our technology is a game changing product capable of delivering benefits worldwide by dramatically reducing;
• energy required to automate everyday tasks in many applications
• volume of raw materials, including copper and magnets, used to    manufacture automated systems
• inventory and therefore administration complexity
• weight, thereby reducing fuel use in logistics and shipping
• Carbon Footprint in manufacturing and distribution
• need for sourcing manufacturing capability outside Europe</objective>
