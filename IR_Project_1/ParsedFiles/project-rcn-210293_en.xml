  <acronym>AFTERLIFE</acronym>
  <objective>AFTERLIFE proposes a flexible, cost- and resource-efficient process framed in the zero-waste and circular economy approach for the recovery and valorisation of the relevant fractions from wastewater. The first step of such process is an initial step consisting of a cascade of membrane filtration units for the separation of the totally of solids in wastewater. Then, the concentrates recovered in each unit will be treated to obtain high-pure extracts and metabolites or, alternatively, to be converted into value-added biopolymers (polyhydroxyalkanoates). Moreover, the outflow of the process is an ultra-pure water stream that can be directly reused.

The outcomes of the project will be focused on:
- Demonstration of an integrated pilot using real wastewater from three water intensive food processing industries (fruit processing, cheese and sweets manufacturing) 
- Demonstration of the applicability of the recovered compounds and the value added bioproducts in manufacturing environments

The design and optimisation of the AFTERLIFE process following a holistic approach will contribute to improve performance and reduce the costs  associated to wastewater treatment by maximising the value recovery.</objective>
