  <acronym>ANGELS</acronym>
  <objective>ANGELS is a high precision instrumental guidance system at the price of an optical guidance system. ANGELS makes use of standards and context aware customizable predictive software to dramatically increase the level of safety in Approach &amp; Landing (A&amp;L) operations. ANGELS focuses in a very specific scenario: Helicopters A&amp;L operations to helidecks at wind farms and Oil/Gas (O/G) rigs (our primary market), where poor visibility (optical guidance systems donâ€™t help), complex glide paths (non straight line approaches), high density of obstacles and reduced space are a constant, and where decision makers (usually helidecks constructors and helicopter service companies) are very sensitive to price (small companies), who need affordable instrumental guidance solutions to comply with requirements from platforms managers.</objective>
