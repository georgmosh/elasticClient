  <objective>Chemotherapy, often given in conjunction with other therapies is infamous for its off target associated side effects. Recent studies have shown that drugs combinations can act synergistically at certain ratios and are more effective and less toxic than single drug therapies. Despite promising in vitro results, combination drug therapy for Oncology has not been successfully translated to the clinic due to lack of efficient delivery systems that can maintain the desired synergistic drug concentrations in the body as each drug has a different pharmacokinetics and toxicity profile. The objective of this project is to develop a universal platform for simultaneous delivery of multiple drugs to specific cells in vivo using a protein cage that was developed in our laboratory for encapsulation of diverse cargoes.</objective>
