The aforementioned smartness will be enabled by a number of technologies and devices embedded all around urban fabric. Street benches, as one of the most common elements of urban space, are one of best devices for implementation of new ICT and energy technologies in cities. Steora aims at becoming a cornerstone of implementation of new technologies in open areas in cities.

Proposal is related to work programme topic “Stimulating the innovation potential of SMEs for a low carbon and efficient energy system”. Include Ltd’s vision is to become one of the major manufacturers of innovative and useful products worldwide.
