  <objective>This project is about the understanding of the structure and dynamics of hadrons in terms of their partonic constituents, quarks and gluons. The aim of this project is to achieve a state-of-the-art determination of collinear fragmentation functions (FFs) of charged pions and kaons, and of unpolarized transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) of the proton. Cutting-edge statistical and computational tools, previously developed for a determination of collinear parton distribution functions (PDFs), will be generalized and used in conjunction with all the experimental information currently available. The results obtained on the one hand will provide precision tools for phenomenological studies in hadron-particle and high-energy collider physics, and on the other hand will improve the knowledge of nucleon structure and hadronization.</objective>
