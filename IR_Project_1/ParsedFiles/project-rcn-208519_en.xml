  <objective>Kidney Disease in England costs more than breast, lung, colon and skin cancer combined. In particular, chronic kidney disease (CDK) affects 10% of the population worldwide. This is bound to increase as our population ages and, if CKD is not detected early enough, the patient may progress to kidney failure which requires therapies (dialysis or transplantation) that are extremely costly and weighs heavily on healthcare budgets. Even though several cheap traditional tests already exist based on a diagnosis of urinal or blood samples, there is no technology available to measure both key RNA biomarkers of kidney diseases and perform traditional chemical analysis. The development of fast multiplex quantitative PCR (qPCR) technologies offers a unique opportunity to propose a Point of Care Test (PoCT) able to perform new multifunctional cheap diagnostics.

By hiring an Innovation Associate with an expertise in microbiology and chemistry, ELVESYS wants to develop the first multifunctional, fast and affordable PoCT device for kidney disease diagnostics. This system will enable any practitioner to propose a diagnosis based on the simultaneous analysis of urinal and blood samples in a single test during the time of a visit to the doctorâ€™s office. 

The Innovation Associate will benefit from ELVESYS expertise in the world fastest multiplex qPCR system to develop this first prototype. The MULTIDET project is relevant to bring a PoCT system to the market within the next couple of years. This system will bring ELVESYS to a pioneering position for multifunctional PoCT systems to solve medical and social issues of kidney diseases that weigh severely on the EU healthcare systems. This project will also allow ELVESYS to train an Innovation Associate in entrepreneurship so that they can later become part of the team or start their own spin-off company to commercialize the PoCT system developed.</objective>
