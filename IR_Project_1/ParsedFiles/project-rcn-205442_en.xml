  <objective>The proposed project is built on the successful training and research experience of the leading European research groups
working in the field of cavity optomechanics. Our ENT unites a total of 14 leading groups in the field, of which two are major industrial players that utilize MEMS and NEMS - Bosch and IBM.  The main goal of the project is to exploit optomechanical interactions in views of novel functionality and possible applications of cavity optomechanical systems that were envisioned by consortium partners during their previous research activities. 
The possible applications include for instance MEMS sensors based on two-dimensional materials like graphene, quantum limited microwave amplifiers, and low noise optical to microwave frequency photon converters. While the majority of the experiments will firmly reside in the realm of classical, albeit weak, signals or fields, the aspired performance will also allow exploiting schemes in scenarios where quantum nature of the signal is relevant.</objective>
