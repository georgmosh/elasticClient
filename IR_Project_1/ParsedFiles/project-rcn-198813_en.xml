  <objective>NANONTUN3D will take advantage of the possibilities of Additive Manufacturing (AM) together with the development of a specially tailored Ti- based nano-aditived material to achieve dramatic improvements in structural parts of aero, space, mobility, and equipment sectors, reaching expected savings between 40% and 50% of material in critical applications. inherent benefits of AM will be kept (decrease in throughput times, tool-less production, high buy-toâ€“fly-run ratios, etc.). 
By adding nano-particles (np) to metal matrixes, the whole life cycle of the NANOTUN3D material has been designed with AM processability in mind: safety and handling issues, processing in well-known AM technologies, postprocessing and eventual certification issues are dealt with, and innovative core-shell treatment of the nano-particles that suits the Ti matrix and produces Ti64-like powder ready to be AM processed. A whole Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) management system will also be developed, as well as all the protocols to start qualification/certification of material and process.</objective>
