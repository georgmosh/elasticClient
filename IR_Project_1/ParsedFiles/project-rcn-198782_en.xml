  <objective>The aim of the project is to collaboratively address a common innovation support challenge; namely to improve eco-innovation support services in smaller manufacturing companies from traditional sectors in the peripheral regions, where innovation services offer is often weak. The most important outcome is a joint Design Option Paper, which will serve as a “guide” or a “handbook” to other agencies and business support centres to provide similar, more focused services on eco-energy efficiency.</objective>
