  <objective>This proposal fits within the framework of aircraft effectiveness constant improvement by reducing fuel and power consumptions. Its ultimate goal is to economically remove ice accreting on aircraft structure critical parts and thus increase reliability and mass saving on the global function. By comparison with the present existing solutions which are based on active pneumatic and electro-thermal means the targeted solutions will enable electrical power consumption, cost and mass reductions and ease the overall integration process.
The subject of this proposal is to integrate and test two innovative ice protection systems in aircraft structures. The first system is based on two-phase heat transport and will be tested in a turboprop metallic air intake. The second system is based on electromagnetic induction and will be tested on a wing fixed leading edge and on a flap leading edge.</objective>
