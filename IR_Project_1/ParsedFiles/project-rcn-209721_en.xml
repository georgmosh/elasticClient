  <objective>This project proposes to organise and hold the MANUFUTURE 2017 conference in Estonia during the Estonian Presidency. The conference will focus on the competencies and capabilities that EU companies should develop to move into higher value activities and to become globally competitive. Three major issues will be addressed in the sub-themes of the conference: energy and resource efficient manufacturing, digital manufacturing and collaborative technology innovation.  The conference will also look at a number of cross-cutting issues: the development of skills, access to finance, the use of innovative business models and better regulation. This project will support the objectives of the Estonian Presidency as well as promoting the success of the European manufacturing sector.</objective>
