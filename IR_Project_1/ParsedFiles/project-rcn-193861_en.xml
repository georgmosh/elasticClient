  <objective>The overall objectives of the project are to deliver services designed to enhance the innovation management capacity of SMEs in The Netherlands between 15 July and 31 December 2014.
These services will comprise both key account management services under the SME Instrument of Horizon 2020 and services to enhance the innovation management capacities of SMEs.

The sub objectives for the first category  are: to develop regional SME innovation management capacity by carrying out an innovation management gap analysis and developing and implementing an coaching action plan for a specific project under the H2020 SME Instrument.
The sub objectives for the second category are: to identify promising SMEs capable of growth and successful internationalisation, to carry out a diagnostic audit to identify gaps in the regional SME innovation management capacity and to develop and implement a tailored action plan to make the innovation system in the company more efficient and effective.

Our goal is to supply innovation management support services to 10 beneficiaries of the H2020 SME Instrument and 40 SMEs with a high potential to grow and benefit from internationalisation outside the SME Instrument.</objective>
