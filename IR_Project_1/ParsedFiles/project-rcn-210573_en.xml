  <objective>The project SSUCHY falls within the framework of the development and optimization of innovative and eco-efficient processes  and constituents for  structural  and  multifunctional  bio-based  composites.  It  is  fully  integrated  into  the 
research program of the Bio-Based Industries (BBI) Joint Technology Initiative operating under Horizon 2020, and particularly  focused  on  BBI  Value  Chains  1  which  is  dedicated  partly  to  the  transformation  of  lignocellulosic 
feedstock to advanced bio-based materials. Our project is clearly positioned on the development of composite constituents
, based on a renewable resource (i.e. biopolymers and plant fibre reinforcements) for the development of multifunctional 
biodegradable and/or recyclable bio-based composites with advanced functionalities for applications in transportation (automotive and aerospace) and a  high  value  market  niche  (acoustic  and  electronics).
It  is  dedicated  to  the  development  of  specific  concepts, technologies  and  materials  to  achieve  a  complete  value  chain  and  prove  the  principle  at  the  scale  of  product demonstrators.</objective>
