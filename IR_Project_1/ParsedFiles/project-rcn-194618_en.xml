  <acronym>TRUST-EPC-SOUTH</acronym>
  <objective>The overall objective of TRUST-EPC-SOUTH is to scale up investments on Energy Efficiency (EE) and other Sustainable Energy (SE) in the tertiary sector of southern European countries, with particular focus on Energy Performance Contracts (EPC) projects. This objective will be achieved through the development of an ad hoc investment standardization and benchmarking framework and supported with the organisation of tailored capacity building activities that will allow project developers (including ESCOs , ESPCs  and other EPC providers), project sponsors and tertiary sector actors to more easily access third party financing, thus unlocking the large tertiary sector EE/SE market potential.

Geographically, the project will be carried out in the following 6 countries: Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Croatia and Greece, in which we both see a need to improve the situation and a large untapped market potential in the tertiary sector.</objective>
