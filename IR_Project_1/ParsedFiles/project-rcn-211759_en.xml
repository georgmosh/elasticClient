  <objective>Introduction:
Smartify CIC’s mission is to help people make meaningful connections with art and to support the audience reach and financial resilience of art venues.
Using image recognition to instantly identify artworks, Smartify app then returns engaging text, audio and video commentary. Each scan can be added to the users’ personal digital art collection.
Named by ‘The New Scientist’ as “the Shazam and Spotify for art” we are on a journey to create a global platform that democratizes access to art across venues. Smartify is the only company creating a global platform for discovery, saving and sharing art. We bring positive disruption to art venues by offering audiences freedom to follow their own preferences. This is a significant change from the current state of art: traditional linear audio guides do not feature all works on display and must be returned (along with all information) at the end of a visit; paper leaflets and small wall labels; bespoke apps with low-download rates.
Smartify already has partnerships with European museums such as The National Portrait Gallery, Royal Academy of Arts, Reina Sofia and Rijksmuseum, as well as global institutions such as Smithsonian Museums and The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The app currently has 30,000 monthly active users.
As a Community Interest Company Smartify supports venue partners with data, new revenue streams and a portion of profits. Smartify’s business model includes in-app content purchases, branded content and data monetization.

Horizon2020 Project:
In order to increase user retention and monetize the platform, Smartify wishes to develop two new app features: user-generated content and art recommendations which will be offered as premium services. 
Having successfully won a grant from InnovateUK to carry out extensive user-centered design research with partners to validate our concepts, we are looking for the final funding amount to develop prototypes, pilot features and prove our business model.</objective>
