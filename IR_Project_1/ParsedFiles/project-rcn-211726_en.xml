  <objective>POLYTE-EID European Industrial Doctorate will offer excellent training opportunities to 3 Early Stage Researchers in the area of Polymers for Electrochemical Energy Storage. POLYTE-EID puts together the expertise in batteries for automotive of Toyota Motor Europe (TME) with the academic excellence in polymers of the University of the Basque Country (POLYMAT).  The final objective is to train scientists who may face some of the upcoming European energy and transportation challenges. The project proposal is a well-balanced combination of fundamental material&amp;polymer science with applied research in electrochemical energy storage technologies. The project will search the development of new polymeric materials to increase the performance and security of actual and future batteries.</objective>
