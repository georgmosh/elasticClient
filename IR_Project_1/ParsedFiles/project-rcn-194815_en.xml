  <objective>The European Consortium for Communicating Stem Cell Research (EuroStemCell) unites 33 partner institutions, that 
collectively represent &gt;400 stem cell research groupings across Europe. Our common goal is to provide trusted high quality 
information on stem cells accessible to citizens and stakeholders across Europe, through support and further development of 
the multi-lingual European Stem Cell Information Portal www.eurostemcell.org. To achieve our aims, EuroStemCell will 
adopt the highly structured system for coordinated information management established by the FP7 Coordination and 
Support Action (CSA) also called EuroStemCell. From this, we will implement an ambitious programme of online and direct 
stakeholder engagement with stem cell research and regenerative medicine, aimed at European citizens at all educational 
levels. This will include provision of resources tailored specifically for decision-making on stem cell-related questions and an 
extensive programme of dissemination and capacity building in science communications and public engagement. The 
proposed work centres on an information hub team, which will link to all project partners and to stakeholders in the stem cell 
and regenerative medicine arenas and wider society, working with these groupings to implement the project. All outputs will 
be delivered in 6 European languages, to ensure broad accessibility, and will be rigorously evaluated against measurable 
objectives throughout the project duration. The proposed consortium comprises leading stem cell labs across Europe, 
including new member states, together with experts in ethical and societal concerns and evaluating clinical outcomes. It thus 
provides unparalleled European expertise across the fields of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine and is uniquely 
placed to maintain and further develop www.eurostemcell.org as a world-leading stem cell information resource, thus 
meeting the challenge outlined in Topic HOA-6-2014.</objective>
