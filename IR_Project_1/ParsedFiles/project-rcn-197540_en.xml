  <objective>Europe has built momentum in becoming a leader in large parts of the HPC ecosystem. It has brought together technical and business stakeholders from application developers via system software to exascale systems. Despite such gains, excellence in high performance computing systems is often fragmented and opportunities for synergy missed. To compete internationally, Europe must bring together the best research groups to tackle the longterm challenges for HPC. These typically cut across layers, e.g., performance, energy efficiency and dependability, so excellence in research must target all the layers in the system stack. 

The EuroLab-4-HPC project's bold overall goal is to build connected and sustainable leadership in high-performance computing systems by bringing together the different and leading performance orientated communities in Europe, working across all layers of the system stack and, at the same time, fuelling new industries in HPC.</objective>
