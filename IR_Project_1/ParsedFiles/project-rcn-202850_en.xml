  <objective>In this project I will use Single Molecule Pull-down (SiMPull) for studying activity and regulation of human gamma-tubulin ring complexes (gamma-TuRCs). Gamma-TuRCs are the main nucleators of microtubule (MT) polymerization. Additionally, gamma-TuRCs may play a role in modulating MT dynamics. Regulation of gamma-TuRC activity is key to organizing the dynamic MT arrays needed for essential processes in various cell types. Progress in understanding gamma-TuRC regulation at the molecular level is currently hampered by a lack of information about subunit stoichiometries and interactions, and by technical difficulties that have prevented reconstitution of gamma-TuRCs in vitro. I will tackle these challenges by using SiMPull to immunoprecipitate and immobilize gamma-TuRCs to a glass surface directly from cell extracts collected at different cell cycle stages, and analyze individual gamma-TuRCs using high resolution microscopy. I will express tagged gamma-TuRC subunits in cells to isolate wildtype and mutant gamma-TuRCs. Using fluorescent protein tags and antibodies I will visualize and quantify components in individual gamma-TuRCs and, by incubation in pure tubulin and GTP, determine how gamma-TuRC composition is related to its ability to nucleate MTs and modulate MT dynamics. Together, the proposed research will expand the fieldâ€™s toolbox, thereby allowing new, molecular level insight into gamma-TuRC activity and its regulation.</objective>
