  <objective>This project proposes the organization of five different career days across different regions of Spain (Andalusia, Castilla la Mancha, Basque Country, Cantabria and Zaragoza) in order to address several key issues relevant for the future of the Spanish R&amp;D&amp;I system:
1. Promoting researcher career, in the academia and beyond
2. Giving visibility to the existing European, national and regional funding opportunities
3. Fostering the uptake of professional development initiatives by both, researchers themselves and institutions.
4. Promoting EURAXESS as a key tool to overcome mobility barriers and support researcher career development.
The fact that several career days will be executed by different members of the EURAXESS Spain Network ensures incorporating a regional ecosystem perspective to each of the events, while ensuring that the general objective of all remains.</objective>
