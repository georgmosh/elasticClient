  <objective>"The aim of the current MSCA RISE project CybSPEED is to advance a novel framework for analysis, modelling, synthesis and implementation of Cyber-Physical Systems for pedagogical rehabilitation in special education, based on a combination of the best of experience and achievements of the partners in the domains of brain-aware robotics, cognitive biometrics, computational intelligence and reasoning in humanoid and non-humanoid robots for education.  CybSPEED project builds on the results and insights of the recently completed project funded by EEA Grant of Bulgaria and Norway ""METEMSS: Methodologies and technologies for enhancing the motor and social skills of children with developmental problems"" (IR-BAS), on a logical projection of the EU funded project ""Social &amp; Smart"", called “Storytelling NAO” of Spain (UPV/EHU) and on the ongoing research of the project “Special Education Robot Teaching Assistant (EduBot)” of Greece (EMaTTech) funded by the Stavros Niarchos Foudation. CybSPEED project emphasizes the intrinsic-motivational approach to learning by designing human-robot situations (games, pedagogical cases, artistic performances) and advanced interfaces (brain-computer, eye-gaze tracking and virtual reality) where children and students interact with the novel technology to enhance the underlying self-compensation and complementarity of brain encoding during learning. The CybSPEED project aspires to establish as well as to sustain an innovation network across the EU, Japan in the Far East, Chile in South America and Morocco in West Africa that will pursue top-level research on three levels – 1) analysis of cognitive biometrics signals, 2) modeling of the learner-robot interaction and 3) development of novel instruments toward an optimal design of Cyber-Physical Systems for improved pedagogical rehabilitation in education."</objective>
