  <objective>ELVITEN will holistically tackle all issues impeding the wide market deployment of EL-Vs, by proposing replicable usage schemes to boost ownership or sharing of all categories of EL-Vs by systematic and occasional urban travellers and by light delivery companies.
Existing charge points in the ELVITEN Demonstration Cities, including private ones, will be integrated in a Brokering and Booking service and EL-V charging possibilities will be integrated in the biggest eRoaming platform in the market, to enable EL-V users to charge independently from charge point operators. Sharing services will be set up and supporting policies and incentives will be put in place. ICT tools will be deployed, including a Brokering and a Booking service for EL-Vs and charge points, an EL-V fleet monitoring tool and Eco-Drive app, a Serious Game and an Incentive Management Smart Card. 
One-year long demonstrations with 383 equipped EL-Vs of all categories in Genoa, Rome, Bari, Malaga, Berlin and Trikala, will allow the collection of a big data bank of trip data and users' experiences and opinions after the trips. 
The analysis will shed light on the real driving and charging patterns of EL-Vs, on reported problems encountered and on the usersâ€™ opinions and perceptions. A Cost Benefit Analysis will evaluate the potential market uptake of EL-Vs. Sustainable business models will be proposed for sharing, rental, parking or charge services for EL-Vs and for the deployed ICT tools. Guidelines to EL-V manufacturers and to Planning Authorities will be prepared and agreements will be signed with another 50 Follower Cities so that they transfer in their own regions the ELVITEN usage schemes.</objective>
