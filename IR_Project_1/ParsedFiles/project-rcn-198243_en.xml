  <objective>The E3Canarias 2015-2016 project aims at continuing the activities carried out in 2014 under E3Canarias project, enhancing the innovation management capacity of the Canary Islands’ SMEs through the delivery of 7-day service packages, targeted to the most innovative small and medium size companies in the islands, as well as giving support to the Canary Island beneficiaries of the HORIZON 2020 dedicated SME instrument, as Key Account Manager (KAM).

These 7-day service packages will be delivered to the Canary Islands’ SMEs that have already been active in different innovation and internationalization activities, with significant innovation activities and a high potential for internationalization.

A minimum of 30 SMEs up to 50 SMEs will be mentored, combining two services:

- A maximum of 5 beneficiaries of the HORIZON 2020 dedicated SME instrument phase 1, and 2 beneficiaries of SME instrument phase II.

For the delivery of these services, 2 staff members have been trained for innovation management via the IMP3rove-Academy in 2014. In the following years these 2 staff members will receive a more advanced training from IMP3rove-Academy and 2 other staff members will also be trained.</objective>
