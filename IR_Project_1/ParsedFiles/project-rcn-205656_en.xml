  <acronym>MONROE</acronym>
  <objective>MONROE aims at developing a modelling toolkit that would allow a broad range of stakeholders such as European and national governments, academia, regional and local bodies to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of their specific R&amp;I policies and programmes. The toolkit will assess medium and long-term impacts of R&amp;I policies and programmes on economic growth, job creation, competitiveness, social inequality and  sustainability at various geographical levels ranging from word-wide to European, country and regional levels and for various economic sectors. Using innovative modelling methodologies and online visualisation techniques the developed toolkit will encourage collaboration between different societal actors in the process of co-creation for sustainable R&amp;I driven economic growth.</objective>
