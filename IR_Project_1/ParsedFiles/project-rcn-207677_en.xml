  <objective>"The proposed Initial Training Network entitled ""Piezoelectric Energy Harvesters for Self-Powered Automotive Sensors: from
Advanced Lead-Free Materials to Smart Systems (ENHANCE)"" will provide Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) with broad and
intensive training within a multidisciplinary research and teaching environment. Key training topics will include development
of energy harvesters compatible with MEMS technology and able to power wireless sensor. Applied to automobiles, such
technology will allow for 50 kg of weight saving, connection simplification, space reduction, and reduced maintenance costs -
all major steps towards creating green vehicles. Other important topics include technology innovation, education and
intellectual asset management.
ENHANCE links world-leading research groups at academic institutions to give a combined, integrated approach of
synthesis/fabrication, characterization, modeling/theory linked to concepts for materials integration in devices and systems.
Such a science-supported total engineering approach will lead towards efficient piezoelectric energy harvesters viable for the
automotive industry. ESRs will focus on this common research objective, applying a multidisciplinary bottom-up approach,
which can be summarized by : ""engineered molecule- advanced material- designed device - smart system"". ENHANCE also
seeks to intensify the relationship between academic and private sectors, and to train highly skilled young researchers for
new materials and device technologies. Both are essential to provide a strong European lead over the rest of the world in
this highly competitive industry."</objective>
