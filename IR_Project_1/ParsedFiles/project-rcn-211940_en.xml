  <acronym>COLHD</acronym>
  <objective>A consortium of industrial and academic leading players covering the entire value chain of road transport has joined forces to commonly address the need to prove feasible and environmental-friendly cases of alternative fuels to fossil diesel for road transport, acknowledging the importance of reducing GHG emissions (beyond EURO 6) with affordable developments.
Commercial vehicles using Optimised Liquid biofuels and HVO Drivetrains (COLHD) has the ambition to enable EU purchasers to buy high performance, clean, safe, affordable HDVs, specifically designed to run on alternative renewable fuels, and be able to conveniently run them through EU transport infrastructure. To do so, COLHD will follow a 3-tiered approach, working on technology, infrastructure and removal of additional barriers.
COLHD will optimize and further develop 3 DDF powertrains running on biogas (LBM or LBP) and 2nd generation biofuels (HVO), evaluating the several benefits under testing in the LNG Blue Corridors infrastructure. Therefore, COHLD will allow proving oil substitution on the short and medium term, addressing different markets and ranges. 
Aiming at finally establish a EU market for AF HDVs, COLHD will co-develop cross-wise activities involving all key target audiences: raising awareness of general public, organising workshops with fleet operators and constantly assessing the EC on required policy directives.</objective>
