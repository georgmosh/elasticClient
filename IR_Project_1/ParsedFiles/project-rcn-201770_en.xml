  <objective>Consumers make their final purchase decisions once they are at the store and are heavily influenced by the visual dimension. Up to 40% of them change their minds while they shop. Besides a trade fair visitor has between 5 and 15 minutes to make a truly lasting impression on exhibitor’s stand. Differentiation becomes incredibly important in current global markets in order to obtain a larger market share. Among the range of merchandising options displays are the preferred solution for point-of-sale marketing. Companies use 11,721 units per year on average, 23 million stand displays per year without considering 2,619 trade fair events every year solely in Europe. 
There is a clear business opportunity for innovative displays that fulfill: low-cost high-quality printing, improved durability, reusability and environmental awareness. Our company, TECNOLOGÍAS Y APLICACIONES LÁSER S.L.U., has been working for over four years on a unique display solution based on the use of Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF). VISSUALLY concept integrates three innovative issues to conventional MDF: 1)Adaptation of digital printing technology 2) Control of laser cutting intensity and 3) Novel assembly system: Q-clip (patented). As a result VISSUALLY guarantees an affordable cost solution, excellent printing performance, finished quality never seen before, flexibility and an easy-to-use assembly system that makes the solution reusable. VISSUALLY is clearly superior to current options and an exciting and reliable business opportunity for us. Boosted by phase 1 project, we expect to create 30 jobs and €8,1M net profit in 5 years. A feasibility study including a business plan will be done including a market assessment to confirm our displays acceptance in the sectors (retailers, food, cosmetics); a technical assessment and final testing of our innovative technology; a stakeholder assessment to identify the key players and activities for the next phases of the project; and a complete Business Plan.</objective>
