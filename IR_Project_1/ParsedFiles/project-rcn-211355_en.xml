  <objective>Over one million people around the world suffer from some form of speech disability. For many, everyday communication is a challenge and participating in social and professional activities can be impossible. As a result, people with speech disabilities often feel isolated and/or dependent on those around them. Existing augmentative and alternative communication devices are bulky and awkward to use, and expensive if seeking high levels of accuracy. In addition, attempts to convert these technologies to app format have been widely unsuccessful. Voiceitt has developed Talkitt, a simple app downloadable to any device which translates unintelligible sounds into clear speech in real time. Talkittâ€™s goal is to improve the quality of life of speech disabled people by fostering inclusion and independence and enabling communication through their own voice. Voiceitt is aiming to commercialise two versions of the Talkitt technology, one targeting mild impairments and one targeting severe. During the innovation project, Voiceitt will optimise both apps, scale-up compatibility, and perform a widespread market validation with organisations and end users in four different countries: Israel, the UK, Italy and Spain.</objective>
