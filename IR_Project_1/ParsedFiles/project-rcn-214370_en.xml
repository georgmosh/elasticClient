  <objective>Anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions have seen a steady increase since the industrial revolution. Recent estimates show that 496 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide will be released in the atmosphere between 2010 and 2060. To address climate change, EU needs other technologies that can reduce the carbon dioxide emissions but also that can use the carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere to produce chemicals or fuels; looking at carbon dioxide as a carbon feedstock rather than an undesired waste.
Small organic fuel molecules (e.g. formic acid, methanol) can be produced via photoelectrochemical carbon dioxide reduction. Materials that can harvest sunlight to electrochemically reduce carbon dioxide are the “Holy Grail” of energy sustainable societies; they have the potential to reproduce what nature learned in billions of years: photosynthesis. The action at hand aims at creating a carbon based arificial leaf that can convert carbon dioxide into solar fuels.</objective>
