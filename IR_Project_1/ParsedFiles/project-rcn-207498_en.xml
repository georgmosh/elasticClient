  <objective>PLASA represents the 1st proposal of the Shift2Rail members referred, according to MAAP, to the following Work Areas within the Cross Cutting Activities:
- WA 3.1: Safety
- WA 4.1: Smart Planning

The PLASA project aims at significantly increasing customer experience and system robustness in the European rail sector. On the one hand, it improves planning activities of various stakeholders in the railway system by means of precise railway simulation and, on the other hand, it provides a methodology to manage the safety of the railway system based on risk assessment.
This will be achieved by an holistic approach involving partners of the rail industry, the operators and universities.</objective>
