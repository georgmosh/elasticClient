  <objective>One of medical scienceâ€™s greatest achievements is the development of vaccines. Even if availability is improving, prices are dropping, evidence of effects are increasing and the side effects are fewer, an increasing number of people av voluntarily choosing not to accept vaccines.

This project do not focus on the very visible group of active vaccine opponents, but instead on the less visible group where vaccine is just one of many other issues in daily life. From a public health communication point of view this group is particularly interesting since they is in a phase where they are deciding if they should vaccinate. This group have been hard to study since they are hard to target both with traditional surveys and interview and by traditional media analytics only.

The project will use a mixed method approach for identifying and understanding this group. The methods will have a particular focus on machine learning techniques and semantic analysis. The choice of methodology together with the hosting at FISABIO and the University of Valencia coupled with secondments at the Vaccine Confidence Project at  London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine and with the SME Salumedia, gives the candidate an ideal environment for improving his scientific career.</objective>
