  <objective>Our project aims to fill the gap between flexible electronic technology and design by developing highly predictive, generic, open-source, design-oriented organic and oxide based TFT compact model libraries, to be integrated in commercial Electron Design Automation (EDA) environments for full large area low cost circuit design for novel  applications. These model libraries will be released together with parameter extraction standard templates to assist in the fast transfer between initial prototype device measurements to full product design. Such a facility will open the opportunity for wide flexible electronics design</objective>
