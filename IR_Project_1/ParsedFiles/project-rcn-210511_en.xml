  <objective>The PROSNOW project ambitions to build a demonstrator of a meteorological and climate prediction system from one week to several months ahead applied to snow management, specifically tailored to the needs of the ski industry using a co-design approach. This novel climate service holds significant potential to increase the resilience of socio-economic mountain stakeholders and supports their real-time climate change adaptation potential. PROSNOW will apply state-of-the-art knowledge relevant to the predictability of atmospheric and snow conditions, then develop products well beyond state-of-the-art operational tools. Improved anticipation capabilities at all time scales, spanning from “weather forecast” (up to 5 days typically) to “climate prediction” at the seasonal scale (up to several months), will be achieved through a seamless integration of weather and seasonal prediction products, together with snowpack models, in-situ and remotely-sensed observations and cutting-edge statistical tools in support of the decision making process. The project proposes an Alpine-wide system (France, Switzerland, Germany, Austria and Italy). It will associate research institutions for weather forecasts, climate predictions at the seasonal scale and snowpack modeling, a group of providers proposing high tech solutions for snow monitoring and management, and a relevant ensemble of eight representative resorts in the Alps. The added value of such services for ski resorts will be investigated and documented, making it possible to initiate a commercial exploitation of the service at the end of the project.</objective>
