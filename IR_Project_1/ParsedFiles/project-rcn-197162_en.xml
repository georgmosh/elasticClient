  <objective>State-of-the-art Transport Management Systems conceived in modular approaches do not provide an all-in-one solution to answer SME business-related needs more broadly. To own a holistic TMS requires a long and expensive integration and customization process which makes TMSs not affordable by SMEs who generally lack resources for it. Additionally, none of the current solutions are able to gather real time data to support real time optimization decisions.
At Ruptela we are committed to developing a new, highly competitive and integrated platform providing all the necessary information to transport SMEs and representing an affordable solution for them: INTRANSYS.
INTRANSYS will use our award-winning fleet tracking and management platform TrustTrack as a foundation to integrate continuously updated traffic data, tracking services, rich communication with driver and eco-driving tools into a single cloudbased application. This real-time integration will allow transport companies to optimize operations on the go 24/7.
As we will offer the system as an “all-inclusive” solution, we will drastically reduce the customization and set-up process both in terms of time and costs. We will achieve this goals by providing a SaaS based pricing model adapted to SME size and usage. INTRANSYS’ ease of use, combined with our extremely competitive pricing strategy opens the door for the widespread commercial adoption by SME transport companies who dominates the European transport market. Note that we will allow massive savings on European transport SMEs (up to 19% of all transportation processes) while contributing to the EC’s goal of forcing the reduction of CO2 emissions of the transport industry.</objective>
