  <acronym>LUBRICAIRLESS</acronym>
  <objective>The main objective of the project is to introduce and sell an innovative technology for the lubrication of industrial machinery on the global market.
This technology consists of a new lubrication system by means of oil mist. Compared with existing systems (Venturi and Vortex), it is much more efficient (90% reduction of energy consumption while in operation), more respectful of the environment (based on an analysis of the life cycle) and may also be used in systems that require high viscosity lubrication oils, thus replacing high energy-consuming technology.</objective>
