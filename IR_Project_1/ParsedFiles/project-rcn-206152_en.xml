  <objective>This proof of concept proposal will build on an innovative monolithic diamond Raman laser, with near quantum limited
efficiency demonstrated during the ERC starting grant DiaL. A range of important applications will be scoped and the technology tailored to meet the most promising market demands. The result will be a platform approach to compact laser design taking existing Nd:YAG-based lasers to wavelengths with a strong applications pull that cannot be met with current technology. This will extend the product lines and market penetration of EU laser companies.

This programme has two complementary tracks: working with specialists, we will identify the market pull and the required laser specifications; in parallel, we will engineer the science developed within DiaL to address these needs in a compact, robust and cost-effective way.</objective>
