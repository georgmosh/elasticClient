  <objective>BIGSSS-departs (BIGSSS Doctoral Education in Partnerships) offers doctoral studies in a program that combines close supervision of dissertation work with demand-tailored education, both embedded in a vibrant research landscape at the Bremen International Graduate School of Social Sciences (BIGSSS). The core disciplines comprise political science, sociology, and psychology. Program participants will follow a 42 months structured curriculum including a stay abroad at an external academic partner institution or with an external non-academic partner. BIGSSS has gathered a network of some of the most prestigious international social science partner organizations. With features such as Career day or the Research day, a strong inter-sectorial exposure both in the partner network and with regards to the composition of the curriculum is an essentially new feature of BIGSSS-departs. Through a secure employment contract, the monthly pay in BIGSSS-departs will include health insurance and all German social security benefits already. Even though BIGSSS-departs is connected to a sole beneficiary (University of Bremen), it uses structures and resources of two universities.</objective>
