  <objective>European particle physics groups interested in searching signals of new physics both with neutrinos, at T2K experiment, and at the intensity frontier, with the Belle-II experiment at the SUPERKEKB machine, want to share between them and with KEK laboratory their knowledge in data analysis and detector technologies. Such knowledge sharing will enhance skills and competences of all participants, will allow Europe to play a primary role in the search for deviations from the actually known fundamental physics in the flavour sector and, last but not least, will produce an unprecedented collaboration with japanese scientists on the ground of dissemination and outreach.</objective>
