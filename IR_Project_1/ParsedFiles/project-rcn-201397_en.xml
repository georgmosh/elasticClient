  <objective>A multitude of models have proposed different mechanisms underlying bilingual language control, a process that restricts bilingual language processing to the target language. Many, but not all, of these models assume that inhibition plays an integral role during bilingual language control. However, there is little empirical evidence for such a claim. In the current proposal, a list of 8 experiments are put forward that investigate, in both production and comprehension, whether there is inhibition and whether this inhibition persists and is reactive, as proposed by several models. Moreover, the current proposal also allows for an investigation into the locus of inhibitory control, which is a largely neglected subject. To investigate inhibition, n-2 language repetition costs would be examined, which entail worse performance on language A in ABA than in CBA sequences (with A, B, and C being trials in different languages). Finally, based on a previous comprehension-based computational model of language control (BIA-model) and the data obtained in the current proposal, a computational model of inhibitory control during bilingual language production would be constructed, which is novel in the field.</objective>
