  <objective>The difficulty faced by central banks in dealing with counterfeit currency, cheques and credit cards is a new domain where electronics on paper or plastic can make a big difference. If GMR sensors can be realized on the paper of the currency note or cheques and the plastic of credit card, then we could boost the efforts related to combating counterfeits and simultaneously advance the research in the field of flexible electronics. The integration of GMR components onto a flexible device requires overcoming several practical challenges. Here, we aim in fabricating flexible GMR sensor on paper using FeCo and Cu nanoparticles for potential applications such as currency authenticity tags. This challenging multidisciplinary project will be supported by the outstanding research environment at the host group (Bendable Electronics and Sensing Technologies (BEST) group) led by Dr. Ravinder Dahiya (RD) at University of Glasgow (UoG). The various objectives of this project include; synthesize and characterize controlled composition of FeCo and Cu nanoparticles by polyol process, printing multiple GMR alternate layers of the FeCo and Cu nanoparticles on paper and integrate the paper-GMR sensor with other electronic components on flexible substrates. The developed GMR sensor on paper will be suitable for applications such as authenticity tags for preventing currency counterfeits.</objective>
