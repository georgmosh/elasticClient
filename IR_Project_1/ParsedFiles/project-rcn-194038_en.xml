  <objective>This project proposal aims at establishing the new services of EEN in Flanders with regard to the key account management for the SME instrument under H2020 as entrusted by the European Commission to the Enterprise Europe network. It also concerns the additional support services that EEN will deliver with regard to the enhancement of the innovation management capacities of SMEs as decided the H2020. The present proposal describes how the Flemish VEBIN consortium will establish the new services in the region of Flanders, how these will be embedded in the regional innovation support system to the benefit of Flemish SMEs, how the consortium will manage the services and how feedback will be organised in order to ensure a high quality service provision and an added European value. It particularly reflects on the signposting of clients among all relevant support stakeholders and to the efficient use of existing tools. It also expresses the consortium willingness to cooperate whenever requested by the Commission or by EASME to participate in benchmarking exercises among the various participating consortia and to give feedback on the implementation of these new services in the region of Flanders (Belgium).</objective>
