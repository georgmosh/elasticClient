  <objective>A EUROpean training and research network for environmental FLOW management in river basins

The regulation of river flows is one of the biggest stressors affecting river ecosystems across the world. In many westernised countries, major legislative efforts are therefore underpinning the development of new approaches to mitigate the impacts of river flow regulation (e.g. EU WFD, US Clean Water Act, South Africa National Water Act, Australian Water Resources Act). These approaches are based on optimising the management of river flows to maintain services to humans (e.g. water supply, hydropower) whilst protecting and/or rejuvenating the aquatic environment with water of adequate quantity and quality in space and time (i.e. environmental flows, aka e-flows). In this context, a field of applied aquatic science has developed to generate the evidence base for identifying the best ways to manage the quantity, quality and patterns of e-flows to sustain river ecosystems. EUROFLOW will train a new cohort of researchers to be future leaders in this field.</objective>
