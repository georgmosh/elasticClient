  <objective>This project is directed towards establishing and upgrading large-scale qualification and training schemes in the Netherlands for craftsmen and other on-site workers, in the continuation of the BUILD Up Skills Initiative. The proposed project uses the results of the IEE-projects  and is a necessary step towards closing the gap between existing and needed skills for craftsmen and building workers in the Netherlands in the respect of meeting the 2020 energy objectives.The main objective of the project is to develop and pilot missing training materials on EQF-levels 2 - 4 based on the future-ready qualification schemes developed in BUILD UP Skills Pillar II. Secondary objective is to construct short skill measurement tests which enables the prevention of mistakes made by unconsciously incompetent workers, the detection of skills gaps and supply of industry relevant upskilling advice to craftsmen and building workers.Tertiary objective is to organise regional pilots in which we focus on implementation and evaluation of the developed materials and regional capacity building. We will support regional training partnerships with train-the-trainer sessions, regional labour market intelligence and implementing the developed trainings and assessments in practice in regional building and/or renovation projects. As results of the project the following will be achieved:
• Increase the skills of 3000 craftsmen by the end of year 2018
• Increase in RES-production of 11 GWh/year
• Decrease of energy consumption of 69 GWh/year (EE)
• Increase the employability of the building workforce with 3000 of which at least 5% women
• Increase in investments in innovative sustainable energy technologies with €42.7 million
• Acquired additional funding of €1.000.000,- to sustain the action</objective>
