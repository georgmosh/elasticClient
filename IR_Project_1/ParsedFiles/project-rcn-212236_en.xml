  <objective>The SpeakNGI.eu project aims to establish and enact an open, dynamic and continuous consultation process with initially 8 key stakeholder groups on a citizen centric quest to discover their needs for the Next Generation Internet (NGI). The multi-facet consultation process will be governed by a SpeakNGI.eu established, self-sustaining European Champions Panel (ECP) that will initially be composed of carefully selected stakeholder representatives. SpeakNGI.eu will ensure that the ECP along with the established consultation processes will sustain right through to support the highly ambitious NGI Flagship.</objective>
