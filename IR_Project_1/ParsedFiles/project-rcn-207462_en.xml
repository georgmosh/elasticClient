  <objective>GETM3 – Global Entrepreneurial Talent Management 3  - focuses on young talent as a key driver of future development, developed through co-operation of 3 stakeholders: employers (inc MNC &amp; SME’s), universities and students/graduates. Despite a widely recognized importance of young talent (e.g. Europe 2020), its potential remains largely untapped.  They are educated and entrepreneurial and yet experience instability in employment. At the same time, employers report skills mismatch and difficulties with attracting, managing and retaining young talent. To tackle this paradoxical situation, an innovative, multi-perspective approach is needed, reinforced by our 15 partner consortium; comprising of a transnational, inter-disciplinary, inter-generational, gender balanced and inter-sectorial research team. 
The main objective of GETM3 is to improve employability and future global talent management to support economic development by capitalizing on entrepreneurialism as a key characteristic of the young. To achieve this objective, the project is divided into six work packages. Three WPs focus on in-depth research of specific issues from each of the stakeholder perspectives. The Integration and Innovation WP, essential for impact, aims to integrate research outputs and develop GETM3 across dimensions: generations, genders, disciplines, countries, sectors and stakeholders. These are supported by a project management &amp; administration WP and by the Researcher development, knowledge transfer &amp; dissemination WP. In total, 292 mobility months are planned, 232 of those are for EU partners. Matched funding specially dedicated to H2020 will be claimed from the Korean Research Foundation. The overall design of the project builds impact through researcher mobility in two ways: researchers will gain first hand and in-depth insights on specific issues from various perspectives, and will develop their skills through networking and training incorporated into mobility with sandpit events.</objective>
