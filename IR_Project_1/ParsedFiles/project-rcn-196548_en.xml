  <objective>More than 25 million tonnes of plastic waste are produced every year in the EU28 (50 kg per EU citizen). Although the rates of plastic waste recovery have increased (26% mechanical recycling; 35.6% energy recovery), 38.4% of this waste is still landfilled (9.6 million tonnes). This goes against the EU Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC as it has a high environmental impact (0.105kg CO2/kg plastic waste landfilled; production of one million tonnes of CO2) and wastage of resources (€590/tonne of recycled plastic ; losses of €5,664 M).

INTERVAL, S.A. is a family-owned business created in 1982 specialised the recycling and transformation of plastics. We employ 22 people and have an annual turnover of €3,240,066. We produce more than 7,000 tonnes of plastic products per year using the most advanced technology in our production processes.Through ReDurComp, we aim to launch innovative, low-cost products onto the EU market based on premium recycled PE. We will start by introducing two products for which a clear market need has been identified (i.e. plastic sacks for household waste collection and plastic covers for pallets). As a whole, sales of about €48.3 million are forecast within a five-year period, generating profits of over €4.8 million.
 
During phase 1, a feasibility study including a business plan will be developed  in line with the overall internationalisaton and growth plan of our company. This study will include: (1) a market assessment to confirm INTERVAL’s products acceptance in the two segments considered; (2) a technical assessment to validate our recycled PE material according to relevant EU standards and procedures, as well as final testing; (3) a stakeholder assessment to identify the key players and activities for the second and third phases of the project; (4) a complete Business Plan including a cost analysis of raw materials and production activities, marketing and sales strategies, target market, investment requirements, and sales partners.</objective>
