  <acronym>DENOVO-RBC</acronym>
  <objective>The research conducted in SYSTEM_US (ERC Advanced Grant #232816) has led to the discovery of valuable biomarkers for the quality of red blood cells (RBCs) in standard blood bank storage conditions. Using a combination of systems biology and metabolomics, this discovery will lead to the development of novel RBC storage technologies including additive solutions and diagnostics. These technologies will become valuable assets in the form of intellectual property to large transfusion medicine companies and will save thousands of lives over the coming decades. This proposal covers the needs to fully define the market and NPV of the developing technology, fully define the regulatory and clinical path of product approval, file for patents to protect the intellectual property, conduct necessary validation experiments, and continue to develop relations with industry contacts.</objective>
