  <objective>Citizens' digital health literacy is an essential element for successful eHealth deployment. However, citizens often do not have the necessary skills to find, understand and appraise online health information and apply their knowledge to make health decisions. Digitally health literate citizens are empowered to play a more active role in their health self-management, resulting in improved prevention, adherence to a healthier lifestyle and better health outcomes.

IC-Health will provide support for the improvement of digital health literacy in Europe. In particular, the project will design 35 open access online courses (MOOCs), in seven different national languages, for different population cohorts including children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating women, elderly and people affected or susceptible to be affected by type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

The identified population cohorts, along with health professionals, academics and other practitioners, will be organised in Communities of Practice and involved directly in the co-creation of the MOOCs content and structure. Once the courses are be designed, they will be tested by the members of the CoPs and by other users. MOOCs use and impact will be monitored and assessed in order to ensure their uptake and sustainability beyond the duration of the project.</objective>
