  <acronym>PROFILE</acronym>
  <objective>The PROFILE Innovative European Industrial Doctoral programme will develop improved tools for stratification of patients with the autoimmune disorder acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Patient stratification is needed in order to further develop personalized medicine approaches for human disorders. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the disease at the molecular level is needed. Furthermore, implementation of a robust set of novel biomarkers is essential for stratification of patients. Also, highly flexible platforms to rapidly develop novel therapeutics are crucial to further boost the field of personalized medicine. The research program is embedded in a unique translational training program, which emphasizes clinical needs as a driving force for development of novel, innovative diagnostics and therapeutics (for personalized medicine). There is intersectoral knowledge transfer between academia and companies at the European level as 6 different EU Member states are involved in the network either as beneficiary or partner organization. The PROFILE network will allow 6 early stage researchers to follow this unique translational training. They will be trained in the clinic to identify clinical needs, in academia where they will contribute to a scientifically ambitious project and in the non-academic sector where they will be trained in a novel technologies and commercializing bioassays endowing them with an unique PROFILE for further advancing personalized medicine in Europe.</objective>
