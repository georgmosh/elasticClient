  <acronym>ScoliosisManager</acronym>
  <objective>Scoliosis is a three-dimensional (3D) deformity of the human spinal column and ribcage, caused by lateral curvature deviating from the midline. It has been calculated that 10% of all children have scoliosis, 2.5% requiring treatment (80% girls, 20% boys): it is of paramount importance for the health and self-esteem of these adolescents. As core of conservative treatments, braces have been used for decades with the aim of halting and possibly reversing the progressive nature of the deformity. The overall objective of ScoliosisManager is to provide monitoring mHealth services for the kids to help them to comply with the therapy: ScoliosisManager is a tool for patient empowerment and self-management of the treatment. Additionally, mHealth services are also provided to parents so that they can quickly identify non-compliant and abnormal behavioural patterns in order to provide timely help and, at the same time, a powerful tool for physicians and orthotists. As business opportunity, it is estimated a potential global market of â‚¬ 252 million per year.</objective>
