  <objective>EuroDairy will foster development and dissemination of practice-based innovations in dairy farming on key sustainability issues for the post-quota era. Work Package 1 (Project co-ordination) oversees formation of the Thematic Network, ensures interconnectivity in generation, capture and demonstration of innovation and best practice, and reports project outputs including recommendations for further innovation-driven research. WP 2 (Network of innovating pilot farmers and Knowledge Transfer Centres) establishes a community of innovating dairy farmers which through experience and practice on their own farms, bring good ideas and implementable solutions to EuroDairy. The farms participate in regional multi-actor operational groups, and connect as a network to share knowledge across borders. WPs 3-6 focus on four key topics - Resource efficiency, Biodiversity, Animal care, and Socio-economic resilience. These WPs provide leadership, direction and technical expertise for the exchange of innovative thinking, tools, technologies and best practice across the thematic network (pilot farmers, Knowledge Transfer Centres, and regional operational groups). WP 7 (Synergies in scientific and practice-based knowledge) draws from WPs 3-6 to capture new insights from combining science with practice-based knowledge, including benefits and trade-offs in solutions identified. WP 8 (Production and communication of end-user materials) implements a mix of novel and tried-and-tested approaches to internal and external communications. A diverse range of end-user outputs will be produced, made widely accessible to farmers.  EuroDairy supports H2020 objectives to increase productivity, improve competitiveness and impact less on the environment. Involvement of dairy levy bodies, farmersâ€™ organisations and cooperatives in an interactive, bottom-up approach will ensure practical relevance, and multiply benefits across Europe. Direct links to Hennovation and AgriSPIN, will add value to the project.</objective>
