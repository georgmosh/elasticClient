  <objective>PROPHETS will look at redefining new methods to prevent, investigate and mitigate cybercriminal behaviours through the development of a coherent, EU-wide, adaptive SECURITY MODEL, built upon the interplay of the human factors within the new cyber ecosystem and capable of addressing the four fundamental dimensions at the core of the phenomenon: 1. early identification of security threats; 2. investigations within a new public-private governance; 3. Increased complexity of the response due to the expansion of the security perimeter towards new societal fields and the emergence of challenging jurisdictional problems; and, last but not least,  4. perception of security and freedoms among citizens, which requires a new communication strategy for LEAs and security policy makers.</objective>
