  <objective>The following proposal addresses the topic “Establishing services enhancing the innovation management capacity of SMEs in the Enterprise Europe Network”. The new services will be established as an integral part of the network’s services addressing the innovation needs of SME’s, namely the provision of technology audits and technology transfer partnering services.
The services will be provided to two specific groups of companies:
1. Beneficiaries of the SME Instrument.
2. SMEs with significant innovation activities and a high potential for internationalisation.
In order to contribute to smart growth in the European Union by increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of investments in research, development and innovation as well as by contributing to a better and more efficient connection of actors along the innovation chain, DD will provide services for the two groups of companies. 
The aim of the new service package is to support SMEs during their internationalisation processes and to optimize their innovation management capacities. These innovation support activities will help to create economic impact (competiveness, growth and jobs) from innovation activities in SMEs.</objective>
