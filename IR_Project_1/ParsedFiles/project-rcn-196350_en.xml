  <objective>The proposed EMInstr project aims to elevate the important research result, a lab prototype of a new wavelength scanning interferometer (NWSI) developed during the ERC-2008-ADG 228117 SURFUND project and to verify its potential as a commercial product. The EMInstr project intends to set up a commercialisation pathway: from verification/validation of the lab prototype, through to technical optimisation, product prototype design, technological licensing and finally into commercialisation. The expected result of this project is to develop a new generation instrument, a pre-production NWSI, for embedded metrology.

The NWSI represents a step-change in manufacturing metrology instruments, being the first of a new generation of micro/nano geometry and surface topography measurement systems. This revolutionary device is the result of integrating several advanced technologies, wavelength/frequency scanning, GPU electronics and a multi-interferometry configuration, to produce the NWSI with unique capabilities in high-speed, large-measurement ratio (range/resolution) and robustness.</objective>
