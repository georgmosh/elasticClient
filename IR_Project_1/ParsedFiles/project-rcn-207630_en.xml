  <objective>Spectacular breakthroughs in astronomy have been driven by a combination of observational advances and groundbreaking  computer simulations. Simulations are now accepted as being essential for the interpretation and exploitation of data. Europe is a world leader in this area. Our aim is to build on the highly successful FP7 LACEGAL IRSES to avoid fragmentation of expertise and concentration of supercomputer resources in a few groups. The expansion of LACEGAL will build new research collaborations between Europe and the main centres in Latin America and China, and enhance those established under IRSES. The bulk of exchanges will be undertaken by Early Stage Researchers, who will gain access to unique training in high performance computing, equipping them with skills which are much sought after in academia and industry. We also plan network-wide workshops to share knowledge and provide specialized training, disseminating project results and expertise beyond the membership of LACEGAL. Our research program addresses key questions in galaxy formation and the large-scale structure of the Universe. An important goal is to produce the multi-wavelength theoretical models which are urgently needed to meet the challenge posed by upcoming observations. LACEGAL is particularly timely as it will allow us to analyse new data and to prepare for major international projects in which LACEGAL scientists have leadership: 1) The Dark Energy Survey, 2) the European Space Agency's Gaia mission, 3) The Atacama Large Millimetre Array. 4) The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey, 5) The PAU Camera Survey, 6) The Javalambra Survey, 7) ESA’s Euclid mission, 8) The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, 9) The Square Kilometre Array. LACEGAL will help Europe to play a leading role in the breakthroughs expected from these major international projects.</objective>
