  <acronym>ODORPREP</acronym>
  <objective>LabSevice is a company that provides analytical solutions in the area of environment, food industry and polymer characterization. We have already developed a prototype of OdorPrep,  which will be the first automatic and remote sampling system for odor emissions in accordance with the EN 13725 Quality Air Standard.  Thus the objective of this project is the full industrial development of the current OdorPrep prototype for industry uptake as part of an odor emission management and control system in accordance to legislation. That includes the development of the final product, upgrading, controls and certifications and patent protection.
Odor emissions are an environmental pollution problem in Europe, being at the top of the list of air pollution complaints . Odor emissions occur during the operation of industrial sites (livestock farms, composting sites, landfills, refineries, etc.) which are regulated under different laws in Europe such as the Environmental Protection Act in the UK, or the Federal Emmission Control Act in Germany.</objective>
