  <objective>Adaptive optical elements that enable dynamic control of optical paths are essential components of the last generation of commercial optical devices in a wide range of sectors, including smart phones, microscopy and 3D printing. The main goal of the SMARTLENS project is to exploit a recently developed technology to create a new paradigm in optical imaging by transforming at low cost any conventional static optical lens into an adaptive lens whose imaging properties can be dynamically shaped almost at will. Throughout the project we will advance the maturity of the technology, design and implement a demonstrator as well as establish the exploitation and commercialization strategies.</objective>
