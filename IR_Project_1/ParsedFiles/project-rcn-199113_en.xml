  <objective>The aim of this project is to bring together subject matter experts from the academic and non-academic sectors to develop three new categories of quaternary ammonium salts to be used as catalysts for the cost-efficient and green manufacture of high value active pharmaceutical ingredients. 
In order to achieve this objective the proposal brings together 3 partners with complementary skills:
University of Naples(UNIN): experts in the preparation and purification of cyclic peptides. Experts in solid phase synthesis and immobilisation of peptides on solid support.
KelAda Pharmachem: Phase transfer catalysis/organo catalysis/scale-up  of chemical processes
University of Linz(JKU Linz): experts in design of new ammonium salts and optimisation of enantioselective phase transfer catalyses. 

We have broken this proposal into the following separate Work Packages:
WP1. Preparation of new designer ammonium salts [WP leader: Kelada]
WP2. Preparation of cyclic peptide based ammonium salts [WP leader: UNINA]
WP3.  Evaluation of new ammonium salt catalysts prepared through WP1  [WP JKULinz]
WP4.  Evaluation of new Ammonium salt catalysts prepared through WP2[WP leader: UNINA]
WP5.  Application of Ammonium salts to drug production [WP leader: Kelada]
WP6.  Scale up of key steps or the manufacture of drugs  [WP leader: Kelada]
WP 7. Management, Communication &amp; Dissemination  [WP leader: KelAda]

The above WPâ€™s will be undertaken via a series of interlinked secondment of researchers between consortium partners and will be complemented by a series of training and other initiatives to facilitate interdisciplinary and intersectoral knowledge sharing and exchange.</objective>
