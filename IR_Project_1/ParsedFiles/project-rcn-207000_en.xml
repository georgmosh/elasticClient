  <acronym>SOLUTION</acronym>
  <objective>SOLUTION will provide research and training program for 14 early stage researchers (ESR) pursuing their PhD in various
disciplines covering the broadly defined area of solid lubricant coatings. The project combines theoretical approaches
represented by advanced nanoscale simulations, laboratory design and fabrication of novel solid lubricants supported by
simulations, and the up-scaling of promising solutions and their application in selected emerging engineering applications.
SOLUTION will link industries from various areas dealing with similar issues through intensive training and knowledge
sharing. Three topics driven by industrial partners have been selected to demonstrate the added value of simultaneous
development and training. The use of modern solid lubricants underlines the transformation of industry towards smart
design, which is based on predictive models and cross-communication throughout the entire production chain.
Fellows supported by the project will have a unique opportunity to gain competence ranging from simulation, characterization
and processing, to industrial processes and entrepreneurship. Highly individualized multidisciplinary training reflecting actual
market needs, together with scientific excellence, will generate an open-mind generation able to harvest multidisciplinary
knowledge and to successfully face challenges represented by the design of competitive solid lubricants.</objective>
