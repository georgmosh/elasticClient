  <objective>PICASCO aims to deliver the commercial proof of concept of a novel endto- end flow manufacturing and a novel corresponding compact flow mini plant. This is performed through the first continuous 4-step solvent-free flow manufacturing of a pharmaceutically relevant API compound at an industrial scale. Currently applied batch manufacturing techniques leave much room for improved quality, efficiency, cost-effectiveness and environmental friendliness. Flow multi-step manufacturing can address all these issues simultaneously, but to date has not been brought to an industrially useful scale. PICASCO sets out to scale this final barrier.</objective>
