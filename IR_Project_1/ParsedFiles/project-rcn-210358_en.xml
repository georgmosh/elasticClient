  <objective>Renewable energies such as solar and wind are intermittent and require efficient storage methods. One of the most promising methods for renewable energy storage is water splitting, which converts these energies into hydrogen fuel. Solar or wind-driven water splitting can be done using electrolyzers, and alkaline electrolyzers are potentially scalable because they do not use precious metal catalysts. However, current alkaline electrolyzers employ catalysts that have low efficiencies and are prone to corrosion. This project aims to apply several novel classes of water splitting catalysts developed in our ERC Starting Grant project in alkaline electrolyzers. The catalysts are inexpensive and have higher energy efficiencies than those employed in commercial alkaline electrolyzers. They are potentially more stable as well. The goal of the project is to provide technology demonstrators for the use of these catalysts in alkaline electrolyzers, which is expected to result in higher efficiencies and stability at a similar cost.</objective>
