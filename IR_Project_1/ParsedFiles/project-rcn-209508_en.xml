• Provide Key Account Management (KAM) services to Danish businesses, which have been awarded grants under the SME Instrument. 
• Provide Enhancing Innovation Management Capacity (EIMC) services to SMEs in 2017-2018. Companies will be assessed via the IMP3rove or Innovation Health Check tools and depending on results, referred on to relevant organisations in the Danish and European innovation eco-system.
In total, under both categories, a minimum of 138 service packages will be carried out. The figure is based on an average of 69 KAM packages coming through SME Instrument, and 69 EIMC cases carried out. If a larger amount of SMEs is granted SMEI projects, the packages will be adjusted accordingly.</objective>
