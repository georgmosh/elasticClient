  <objective>It is generally acknowledged that the web entrepreneurship sector can contribute significantly to the competiveness and economic growth of countries and regions.  However, Europe is clearly lagging behind given that even though there are lots of European web start-ups, most of them rarely grow up to become global leaders. In this context, the position of women seems particularly weak given that only a very small percentage of them are web entrepreneurs.  
Taking into account the limited development of web entrepreneurship in Europe as well as the limited participation of women in the web economy the WeHubs project seeks to create a favourable environment for women web entrepreneurs, by linking together local fragmented ecosystems nodes, and foster networking and exploitation of synergies, into the first European Network for Women Web Entrepreneurs Hubs.  In this respect the project is aimed at providing a strong support to women web entrepreneurs and existing web entrepreneurâ€™s ecosystems enabling the latter to provide dedicated services to women.  
As a result the project will foster the creation and scaling of web start-ups created by women (impact on women), strengthen the existing web entrepreneurs ecosystems through networking and complementary services (impact on ecosystems) and support the emergence of a dynamic European ecosystem for women web entrepreneurs contributing to the formulation of relevant policies, support the implementation of start-up Europe initiative and the wider enforcement of the European digital sector (policy impact).</objective>
