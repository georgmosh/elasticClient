  <objective>The project proposal is aimed at light weight and efficient jet-fuel aerospace propulsion units based on reciprocating engines. Aerospace propellers useful for jet-fuel reciprocating direct drive engines suffer by extreme excitation of vibrations. The objective of the project proposal is to design and test a new propeller useful for such operational conditions. The objective will be achieved by the following steps:
1. Definition of propeller design specifications with respect to the increased level of vibration excitation due to the specific characteristic of the direct drive jet-fuel reciprocating engines.
2. Design of the propeller and its parts and equipment with respect to the increased level of vibrations.
3. Production of the propeller system.
4. Engine testing of the propeller to demonstrate the achievements.
During the first step an already existing propeller will be used for strain-gage measurements on an equivalent AVGAS engine and then of the target jet-fuel engine. Based on the measured differences of stress distribution and its cyclic components the new technical specifications will be established. Based on them a suitable propeller system will be designed, produced and tested.
