  <acronym>Heat-To-Fuel</acronym>
  <objective>Heat-to-Fuel will deliver the next generation of biofuel production technologies towards the de-carbonisation of the transportation sector. Heat-to-fuel will achieve competitive prices for biofuel technologies (&lt;1€/l) while delivering higher fuel qualities and significantly reduced life-cycle GHG reductions. Heat-to-fuel will result in increased Energy production savings (&gt;20%) and enhanced EU’s energy security by the use of local feedstocks which in turn ensured local jobs are preserved and increased. The benefit of combining technologies like in Heat-to-Fuel is, that the drawbacks of the single technologies are balanced. FT and APR are promising technologies for the efficient production of 2nd generation fuels. But currently the economic border conditions don't allow the implementation, similar to many other biofuel technologies. The radical innovation of combining an APR with a FT reactor is the basis to overcome this barrier. The large organic wastes (from HTL or other streams) can be conveniently treated with APR to produce H2. Both dry and wet organic wastes can be integrated, with mutual advantages, i.e. steam production for gasification, HTL and APR preheating; FT heat cooling without external utilities. Using the synergies between these technologies maximizes the total process efficiency. Heat-to-fuel aims will be met thanks to the diversification of the feedstock for biofuels production, reducing the supply costs and upgrading the efficiencies of promising and flexible conversion.</objective>
