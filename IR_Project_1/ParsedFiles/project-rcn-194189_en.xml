  <objective>The objective of this project is to create and collate a consensus of agreement from Ambulance Users and Procurers on the core technology-centric features which, if correctly integrated into a suitably re-designed ambulance, would allow them to demonstrate, evaluate and deliver new models of in-community healthcare delivery, with the primary objective of avoiding unnecessary hospital attendances (&amp; thus admissions) and the associated patient distress and hospital costs. Such a consensus would form the basis of a future PCP for the envisaged vehicle, and such a PCP Specification is in fact an output of this proposed work.</objective>
