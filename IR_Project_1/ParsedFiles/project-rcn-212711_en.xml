  <acronym>YEAST-TRANS</acronym>
  <objective>Industrial biotechnology employs synthetic cell factories to create bulk and fine chemicals and fuels from renewable resources, laying the basis for the future bio-based economy. The major part of the wanted bio-based chemicals are not native to the host cell, such as yeast, i.e. they are xenobiotic. Some xenobiotic compounds are readily secreted by synthetic cells, some are poorly secreted and some are not secreted at all, but how does this transport occur? Or why does it not occur? These fundamental questions remain to be answered and this will have great implications on industrial biotechnology, because improved secretion would bring down the production costs and enable the emergence of novel bio-based products. 
YEAST-TRANS will fill in this knowledge gap by carrying out the first systematic genome-scale transporter study to uncover the transport mechanisms of small xenobiotic molecules by synthetic yeast cells and to apply this knowledge for engineering more efficient cell factories for bio-based production of fuels and chemicals.</objective>
