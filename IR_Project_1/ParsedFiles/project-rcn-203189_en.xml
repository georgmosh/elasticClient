  <objective>The objective of this project is to learn from sharing experience and exchanging different viewpoints and problems encountered while implementing support services and programmes aimed at fostering innovation management capacity in SMEs. The four partners will share the current support services offered to SMEs and will exchange good practices in order to renovate insights and develop a common Design Options Paper. The Design Option Paper will be the result of the peer-review process and will serve as a guide for other innovation agencies interested in implementing the addressed innovation support service. For the best use of the results of the project the goal is set on the possibility to reach as many innovation agencies as possible with the support of the European Association of Regional Development Agencies, EURADA.</objective>
