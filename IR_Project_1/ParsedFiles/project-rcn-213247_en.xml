  <objective>Marketers want to create buzz, but it’s not always so easy. For a marketing message to spread like wildfire, not only does it have to reach the target audience, but it also has to be well-timed and well-placed. SThAR has developed algorithms that improve the chances of getting it right. The Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne spin-off developed DEMOGRAPHICA software capable of identifying where and when to deliver a message most effectively and create buzz both on traditional (offline) and online media such as social media. The software developed by the start-up offers both geographic and temporal targeting for electoral and advertising campaigns. The ideal times and places are not necessarily remarkable in terms of the number of people directly reached, but these people are connected to others, who are in turn connected to others. The resulting dynamic increases the message’s impact. DEMOGRAPHICA allows to scale the execution of F2F campaigns improving the impact and reducing the costs. The challenge for DEMOGRAPHICA is to become the tool for optimizing and managing face-to-face (F2F) street campaign reducing the cost while increasing the impact. The main commercial objective is to achieve the 15% of the European fundraising market (11.5M € revenue) in 3 years at a 0,3% fee.</objective>
