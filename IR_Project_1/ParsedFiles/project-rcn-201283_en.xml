  <acronym>ProHyPro</acronym>
  <objective>A new hypernuclei program based on the exclusive measurement of (p, Î›K) reactions in inverse kinematics is proposed. The program is to be held at the heavy-ion beam facility GSI, Germany. GSI is the only facility worldwide where this measurement can be performed. It is considered as a first step towards a world-unique program dedicated to the population and spectroscopy of exotic hypernuclei at the future FAIR facility.

In ProHyPro, it is proposed to build a prototype of an innovative setup based on a kaon calorimeter and a thick liquid hydrogen target to be inserted inside the R3B setup at GSI. As a proof of concept, we propose to perform the first invariant mass spectroscopy of hyper-16O tagging with K+ mesons, from which we can determine the binding energy and lifetime of hyper-16O with better resolution.

During the period of the ProHyPro project, the Researcher will take an active part in an already approved hypernuclei experiment (spokesperson: T.  Saito) at the Fragment Separator (FRS) at GSI and the first R3B campaign to be scheduled from 2017 to the beginning of 2018.

The project and the Researcher are hosted by CEA (supervisor: A. Obertelli) in partnership with GSI (supervisor: T. Saito).</objective>
