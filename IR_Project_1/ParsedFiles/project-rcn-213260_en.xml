  <objective>Globosoft GmbH aims to optimize the drug development process of drug manufacturers, enabling faster and more efficient development of drugs in Europe and worldwide. For this purpose, Globosoft GmbH has developed the innovative optimization algorithm called BioAhead to optimize acid chain analysis, as part of the protein structure modeling field. The innovation will create growth in terms of income and new job creation and have a high return on investment. The proposed model has a high potential for a fast up-take by the market, considering the savings in time and money and also a cloud technology that will make the model easy-to-use in any country. BioAhead adequately addresses issues related to the society. With faster and more accurate drug development processes, the society in Europe and world-wide can benefit from low- priced medicines, faster drug development and highly specialized medicines, which are currently too expensive for economic development.</objective>
