  <acronym>HELITE</acronym>
  <objective>TEWER has verified that solar fields implemented today are calculated considering a unique design of heliostat and presenting heliostat is not only characterized by the energy which is able to reflect but by how it is reflected. The configuration of the solar field and the influence of geometrical factors are directly related to the production and it is essential to take into account regarding the design, all weather operation conditions in order to get a high technology performance.
Until today, although the market is asking for it, there is no product that allows variable geometry designs of solar field, allowing them to increased the energy efficiency and the overall performance from the field, improving the relation benefit/cost of current systems.
TEWER aims to use this need to sell their pioneer solution in the field of engineering for solar power energy by concentration to be able to demonstrate management companies of solar plants that their product offers a much more efficient and cost-effective technology than the one that exists currently.</objective>
