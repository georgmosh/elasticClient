  <objective>The goal of this project is to allow the recruitment of a very qualified specialist, as innovation associate of Nively, who holds a PhD (or alternative degree) in disciplines related to design of software interfaces (ideally with experience in design of experience for products targeted to old people) or technologies for Ambient Assisted Living. 
The associate will lead the analysis, and design of a highly innovative product to maximise safety of old people targeted to the home (B2C) market, through re-design of an existing product, called MentorAge, currently engineered for the B2B market. The product will have to be designed based on sound market and usability analysis. The project will allow opening up significant opportunities for Nively through the creation of a brand-new “consumer business unit” targeting the very vast “silver economy” market. The project will also yield a significant opportunity to the associate, who will be then offered to manage the new business unit after the end of the project.</objective>
