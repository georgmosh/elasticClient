  <objective>African Swine Fever is a notifiable devastating hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates in pigs. It affects all members of the Suidae family and is one of the most important pig diseases due to its severe socio-economic consequences for affected countries, the difficulty of preventing spread across country boundaries, and the lack of vaccine and therapeutic control measures. We will use genome-wide DNA technologies to understand the Sus scrofa genomic response to the infection. Specifically, we will compare data on both healthy and infected individuals to (1) identify the possible presence of regions under selection. We will also assess (2) the hybridization rate and (3) the interaction strategies between the domestic pig and the wild boar to (4) identify the possible transmission routes in pig diseases.</objective>
