  <objective>The GreenPlay project consists in raising awareness among citizens through the implementation of a real time monitoring energy consumption platform and the development of a serious game.

This system will consist of four key elements: 
• A monitoring energy consumption in real time 
• A web-based platform to monitor its consumption 
• Advice and challenges available for users on the platform to reduce consumption 
• A serious game to raise awareness of users 

The demonstration of this project will take place in three European cities and reach at least 200 homes. These targeted homes, located in public owned buildings, will have to fulfil two conditions:

i. Being heated with electricity
ii. Having an internet access  

The expected impact of the solution is to decrease by 30% the energy consumption of the testing homes.</objective>
