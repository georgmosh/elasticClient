  <objective>The Kamwal 2.2 project aims to propose innovation support services to  Walloon SMEs through the Enterprise Europe Network during the years 2017 and 2018.  The goal of these service is to help SMEs having already a clear growth and internationalization potential to grow more rapidly.
The proposed innovation services are twofold.
A service of dedicated coaching (KAM EEN)will be proposed to  the beneficiaries of the SME Instrument scheme.  This service starts by an assessment of the SME lacks and coaching needs by a specialized consultant from Entreprise Europe Network Wallonia.  It continues by the identification of a  external coach well skilled with respect to the needs of the company.  The coach will therefore work with the company with the support of the EEN team and services.
It is expected that the project will have the opportunity to serve 6 Walloon SME Instrument beneficiaries.
SMEs not involved at that time in the SME instrument but having also a clear potential could benefit from the EIMC EEN service which aims to help them to improve the management of innovation processes.
This will be achieved through a specific tool, CCI MAP, compliant with the CEN/TS 16555-1.
It is expected that a set of a least 24 promising Walloon SMEs benefit from this specialized service.
Both services will be operated by a team of experienced consultants coming from 4 partners from Entreprise Europe Network Wallonia.</objective>
