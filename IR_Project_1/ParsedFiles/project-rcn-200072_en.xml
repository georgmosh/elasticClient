  <acronym>SuperSmart</acronym>
  <objective>Supermarkets comprise various technical disciplines: buildings, heating-, cooling- and ventilations systems. Over one million supermarkets across Europe require ca. 4% of the total electricity. New integrated technologies for more efficient supermarkets are now available and efficiency improvements up to 30% have already been demonstrated. These heating and cooling technologies offer in the mid-term both environmental and economic benefits. The uptake of such efficient solutions is mainly hindered by non-technological market barriers.
SuperSmart tackles different barrier categories, both short-term (awareness and knowledge) and long-term (organizational, political, social), even though an immediate impact on the sector will be expected to come already from the removal of the short-term hindrances. The purpose of the SuperSmart hub is to establish a knowledge transfer and promotion platform devoted to the supermarket sector to educate/train and crosslink stakeholders of various backgrounds in such a way that the uptake of energy-efficient heating and cooling solutions is made possible. Specific objectives pursued by the hub for the supermarket sector contain:
- Reduce the environmental impact and primary energy demand 
- Support the introduction of a new EU Ecolabel for Supermarkets 
- Determine and remove challenges hindering the implementation of  eco-energy supermarkets 
- Raise the expertise level of the different decision makers (non â€“technical and tech. staff) related to energy usage of   equipment and the benefit of integrated systems.  Encourage to supply energy (heating&amp;cooling) to nearby business units or local grids. 
- Conduct direct communication among R&amp;D organizations, suppliers, end users and governmental bodies on potential legislative initiatives
Active participation at 10 conferences &amp; fairs and 5 dedicated workshops will disseminate the information beside trainings, and the online end-user expert panels, manufacture panels and innovation panels.</objective>
