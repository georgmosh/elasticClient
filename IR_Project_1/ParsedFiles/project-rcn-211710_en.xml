  <objective>Blue Farm will enable the fish farming industry to move their production from today’s protected inshore ocean space to harsh weather conditions of the open ocean, through piloting and later commercialising a patented fish cage demonstrated to operate in 10M high waves. Our fish cage is designed and tested to handle 10 meter high waves. Much of the structure is made of concrete that has given low long-term cost in similar oil and gas projects. The fish cage is much larger than traditional fish cages (allowed by larger water resources offshore). This gives economics of scale in operation (e.g. spreading the cost of automation tech). The fish cage provides calm living environment for the fish through a wind- and wave breaker. The openings of the wind and wave breaker are designed by simulation programs run by Egersund Net (world’s largest fish net provider). Also, water quality is better offshore than in inshore environment with dense fish farming activity. This is a feasibility study that will plan marketability and a pilot of this technology.</objective>
