  <acronym>RENESENG II</acronym>
  <objective>The project  goal is  to further advance the emerging area of Bio - process - systems engineering (BPSE) by capitalizing the recent advances and ITN of RENESENG (FP7 - PEOPLE - ITN) toward the following  project objectives :
- Expanding the knowledge for value chains across feedstocks,  products and industries, e.g., by  looking into the potential of MSW (including food waste) energy chemicals nexus.
- Investigating the area of  knowledge management (i.e., data structures, workflows, protocols)  for the effective communication across the diverse academic research scales and industrial applications (i.e., lab to unit operations, to
process and plant design, to business development, sustainability assessment).
- Applying the existing RENESENG tools, models, methods, know how as well as the newly  developed in this project to emerging topics of bioeconomy and links to circular economy,  with special focus on various forms of “waste” biomass (e.g., MSW, glycerol, lignin). Enhancing the network with new aca demic and non academic partners and significantly  contributing via meaningful secondments to the career development of ESR and ER.</objective>
