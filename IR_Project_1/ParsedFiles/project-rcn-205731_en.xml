  <objective>The ultimate goal of this Fellowship, entitled “Multi-wavelength regeneration technologies for advanced modulation optical signals” (INNOVATION) is to train a talented researcher through a research project focused on the development of all-optical regeneration subsystems handling multi-wavelength and advanced modulation signal waveforms in a single device. Focusing on the hardcore issue of multi-wavelength regeneration “how to reduce nonlinear crosstalk for spectrally efficient advanced modulation signals”, the Fellow proposes pioneering concepts including novel nonlinear devices (nonlinear multi-core fibres and phase-sensitive parametric oscillator units), new crosstalk suppression methods (spatial-division-multiplexing and bidirectional oscillation methods). The resulting regeneration subsystems will dramatically reduce cost and power consumption by combining the nonlinear processing with high-speed multiplexing. Finally, the system testing will demonstrate a multi-wavelength (&gt;8 channels), multi-phase-shift-keying (MPSK) signal regeneration in a commercial network, which offers a high-capacity and green technology alternative to core switching nodes. The INNOVATION outputs will significantly increase the competitiveness of European communications industry in broadband technologies. 
    The Fellow – Dr. Feng Wen – will be trained in the fast-growing field of all-optical signal processing, receiving unique training experiences at the host: Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies (Prof. Sergei K. Turitsyn), and industrial partners: Xtera Communications (Dr. Stuart Barnes), France Telecom (Dr. Erwan Pincemin) and OFS (Dr. Lars Grüner-Nielsen). The Fellow will gain a multidisciplinary skillset in telecommunications, as well as fibre-optic and other industrial fields. This project assembles excellent European and Chinese researchers to build a long-term network to enhance EU scientific excellence in optical fibre communication.</objective>
