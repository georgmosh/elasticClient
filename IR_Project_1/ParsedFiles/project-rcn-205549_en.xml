  <acronym>TEMPERA</acronym>
  <objective>TEMPERA will provide international, intersectoral and interdisciplinary state-of-the-art doctoral training to prepare the next generation of specialists in mass spectrometry-based ancient protein residues analysis for biomolecular diagnostics and conservation of cultural heritage material.
Due to their chemical and mechanical properties, proteins have always represented the category of biomolecules most extensively exploited by humans to satisfy basic needs, including: nutrition, clothing, sheltering and transportation. However presently there are very few specialists that have been trained to analyse ancient proteins, in stark contrast to the study of ancient DNA. The growing demand of information provided by mass spectrometry-based ancient protein sequencing will require highly specialised profiles with a multidisciplinary background in analytical chemistry, engineering, molecular biology, archaeology and art restoration.
Within the TEMPERA network, a team of talented young scientists from both experimental sciences and cultural heritage conservation disciplines will be created and prepared to become a group of highly qualified specialists.
The TEMPERA network aims at:
(i) Forming, through research-based training, the professional profiles behind tomorrowâ€™s state-of-the-art analysis of ancient proteins from cultural heritage materials.
(ii) Consolidating existing constructive interaction across disciplines to focus different expertise and backgrounds into the common aim of safeguarding and enhancing European cultural heritage.
(iii) Stimulating, through the right set of specific research-related and transferable skills, the development of application-oriented mind set for direct or indirect exploitation of TEMPERA R&amp;D activities.
As a key TEMPERA feature, the unique contribution provided by each participating institution will be integrated in a strong partnership to achieve valuable complementary research-specific and widely transferrable professional competence.</objective>
