  <objective>Membrane separation processes can be applied to many capture processes from Pre-Combustion ( CO2-H2 / CO2-CH4 separation) to Post-Combustion (CO2-N2) and Oxyfuel (O2-N2) and are generally endowed with high flexibility and potentially low operative costs with respect to other capture methods. However the current materials are still lacking of separation performance and durability suitable for an efficient and economically feasible exploitation of such technology. 
The Project NANOMEMC2 aims in overcoming the current limitation focusing on the development of innovative CO2 selective membranes with high flux and selectivity suitable for application to both Pre and Post-combustion Capture processes.
To that aim nanocomposite or mixed matrix membranes will be considered with particular focus on facilitated transport mechanisms promoted by carrier attached to the polymer or the filler. 
Graphene based nanosheets and cellulose nanofibres will be studied in detail considering their possible modification to improve polymer compatibility and affinity with CO2. 
A new generation of Facilitated Transport Mixed Matrix ( FTMM) membranes for CCS applications will be developed with increased CO2 flux and selectivity beyond the current target for industrial deployment of carbon capture membrane technologies</objective>
