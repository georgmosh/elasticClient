  <acronym>i-LiveRest</acronym>
  <objective>The aim is to convert the functional prototype from FP7 PUMA project into a commercially-ready intelligent control system and to introduce this new solution for Pressure Ulcer (PU) prevention in the European Assistive Technologies market. The novelties of i-LiveRest are a) to measure PU risk in real time based on Tissue Viability (TV) with impedance, pressure, temperature and humidity textile sensors; and b) to decide the best combination of PU prevention strategies based on risk, user and context. It can be embedded on wheelchair and mattresses. i-LiveRest will be the first ICT solution applied to PU risk detection and prevention.

PU are preventable but 38% of PU appear using current devices because a) risk,  user status and context are not taken into account; and b) PU risk assessment is only based on pressure instead of TV. There is no available solution able to provide the functionalities of i-LiveRest.

Target customers are Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) patients, healthcare public bodies and private insurances. On the one hand, SCI will develop a PU during their lifetime and 7-8% will die. i-LiveRest will increase their sitting time, enhancing their independent living. On the other hand, i-LiveRest will reduce public and private costs related to PU treatment (20 B€/year); injuries of professionals due to manual repositioning (2,000 M€/year); and will increase labour force of SCI and their relatives.

In Phase 1, we need to: assess the technical and economic viability of industrialising i-LiveRest by optimising components; identify providers; prepare CE mark; identify purchasing agents; contact stakeholders; and elaborate a business plan. In Phase 2, we will optimise i-LiveRest system to reduce components size and costs, achieve CE mark and perform a pilot demonstration in four European countries.

i-LiveRest is aligned with key EU global challenges: disability, independent living and job inclusion; reduction of social and health care costs; and increase of labour</objective>
