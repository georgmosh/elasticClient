  <objective>1.3 million – this is the sad number of Europeans dying each year by cancer. JenLab, high-tech company from Germany, has therefore developed an innovative novel diagnostic medical device (TRL 7) based on femtosecond laser radiation for immediate, non-invasive early diagnosis of cancer, particularly skin cancer, within seconds and with ultra-high resolution depicting even subcellular level. This is also true for early detection of ophthalmic diseases which constitute a major burden for Europe’s society –knowing that one European in every 30 is expected to experience sight loss. In addition to intratissue cell imaging, JenLab’s technology is able to measure metabolic processes giving information about diseases even before they become visible – increasing therapy success by early detection and continuous monitoring. Moreover, the technology is applicable for imaging each tissue without labelling but using endogenous biomarkers. 
Outcome of the business innovation project is an miniaturised, certified and by clinical study validated ultracompact, flexible, fast multiphoton tomograph for dermatologists and ophthalmologists, representing an European market potential of EUR 11.4 bn. 
Particularly by its quick and reliable (using 4 different modes of diagnostic) way of diagnosis it meets user needs while simultaneously reducing Europe’s continuously growing health care costs. The business project is in line with JenLab’s philosophy of saving lifes and of facilitate healing as well as it is in line with JenLab’s strategy of developing and producing novel solutions for early diagnosis of life threatening and/or serious diseases.</objective>
