  <acronym>MULTIZONAL SCAFFOLD</acronym>
  <objective>This project is an attempt to develop an effective bioactive wound dressing for the treatment of chronic non-healing wounds that until now depict a major challenge and financial burden to healthcare providers. We propose a zonal, multifunctional scaffold based on collagen (COL) and copper-doped mesoporous bioactive glass (Cu-MBG) serving as release system for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB). The degradable scaffold system is expected to accelerate the wound healing process due to synergy of angiogenetic, bioactivity, and antimicrobial characteristics. 
This will be the first attempt to create a zonal COL-MBG scaffold system with release of three functional molecules, of which PDGF-BB has not previously been incorporated to MBG. Zonal design enables designed consecutive release profiles, e.g. immediate PDGF-BB from the outer layer and delayed VEGF release from the inner layer of the scaffold. 
The structure of the scaffold as well as distribution of specific components and their functionality will be characterized using innovative in vitro models including cell culture tests.
