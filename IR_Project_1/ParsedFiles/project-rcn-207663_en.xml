  <acronym>EPIC</acronym>
  <objective>The project aims to improve cooperation in the area of information and communication technologies between Europe and three partner countries in the Asia-Pacific (Australia, New Zealand, Singapore). EPIC will foster cooperation in ICT research, technology development and innovation-related topics at the policy and the researcher level. The initiative builds on cooperation policy dialogues, the analysis of research capabilities, and on recommendations from previous projects involving these countries. The project follows a topically expanding methodology: cooperation will start from a small set of joint and/or global challenges and continue to expand areas as the project progresses. Initial topics include: smart nations, resilient and sustainable cities, open and digital science. 

The main objectives of the project are:
● Identify, update and detail 3rd country programs, common R&amp;D priorities and future cooperation opportunities 
● Identify synergies between DAE international agenda and 3rd countries/regions' ICT strategies 
● Develop recommendations for improved cooperation 
● Organizing and supporting events that are synchronized with dialogue meetings and contribute to increase their focus and visibility
● Reinforce industrial cooperation on ICT research and development through improved networking activities 
● Support EU organizations/individuals in accessing third country programs 
● Establish linkages with EC programs and initiatives and with MS/AC programs 
● Widely disseminate the objectives and results of the project among relevant  stakeholders through a carefully designed dissemination strategy</objective>
