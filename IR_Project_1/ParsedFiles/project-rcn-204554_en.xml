  <objective>Simultaneous ammonium and methane oxidation coupled to nitrogen removal provides a great opportunity for sustainable and economical feasible wastewater treatment solutions. The key processes performed are anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) and nitrate-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane. Combining these two processes results in a system that simultaneously removes ammonium, nitrate (via nitrite), and methane without the need for extra aeration and the addition of electron donors. Such a system would offer many advantages compared to conventional wastewater treatment plants including lower costs, lower energy consumption, lower greenhouse gas emissions and a much smaller resource foot-print. These unique selling points greatly enhance the potential for market introduction.</objective>
