  <objective>AddiFab has developed the first sacrificial thermoplastic injection moulding platform to support the manufacturing of small/medium size, complex and traceable metal and ceramic components with high precison – STIM-MC. AddiFab’s innovative solution is the first to remove the costly and time-consuming gap between prototyping and commercialization ramp-up.
This is only possible due to AddiFab’s proprietary material and process which uses printed objects as intermediary process tools (moulds). It runs in a single platform which integrates the automatic production and post-processing of moulds.
With single-use moulds produced automatically, prototypes and components with mould-like quality can be launched for in-market validation and easily modified. Thus, the STIM-MC platform reduces development costs, mitigates the risks of product failure and increases process efficiency, while enabling wider benefits for the healthcare, consumer products and automobile industry through new cost-effective materials.
Through the successful development and implementation of the STIM-MC project, AddiFab will be in a strong position to exploit the micro and powder injection moulding markets and enhance its profitability by the stream of the sales, with an expected cumulated revenue of €71 million, 5 years after project completion.</objective>
