  <objective>Offshore Kinetics (OK), an innovative Norwegian SME, has developed a game changing offshore floating wind turbine support structure that will optimise installation, commissioning, operation (maintenance) and decommissioning of wind farms. OKs patented column, stabilization tank, universal joint and anchor provides an effective “all in one” deployment of wind turbines. The concept is considerably more cost efficient than the leading models on floating wind turbines in the world today, and will reduce both Capex an Opex of wind farms. Offshore Kinetics’ overall objective is to upscale, demonstrate, and commercialize our patented Wind Turbine Support Structure (WTSS) solution in the offshore wind market</objective>
