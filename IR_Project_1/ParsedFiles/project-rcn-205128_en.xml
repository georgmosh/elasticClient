  <acronym>EASYPONIC</acronym>
  <objective>Business Opportunity:. Hydroponics is a closed-loop food production system in a controlled environment and grows without soil, also known as soilless growing. It is a sustainable solution for meeting growing demand of food consumption, reduces water waste (+70%) and contamination, increases crop production and enhances the community environmental-care feelings. Despite advantages, the process must be professionally controlled to avoid constant losses ending of users’ disappointment.
Easyponic endeavours to scale-up a cost-effective, easy-to-use ICT based product that provides a solution to control the whole hydroponic process without having a professional knowledge of the methodology. Easyponic is based on a compacted hardware the “Nanny” that cares about the crops and automates the monitoring process by sending the user all the information and actions that should be taken though a mobile application, which engages the users through its gaming features.
Easyponic targets Non-professional growers (B2C) &amp; Small-medium greenhouse farmers (B2B) providing both with a cost-effective solution that engage the user and controls the process through the value of information, preventing alarms and training.
Easyponic has gone through processes of “design thinking” and “customer discovery &amp; validation” - with more than 95k€ already invested - at the national level (TRL6). Our successful demonstration results position us to continue to advance during the next phases in the validation process under the SME Phases 1 and 2, going from TRL6 to TRL9.
Easyponic aims to get 44,5 M€ of incomes by 2021 targeting EU, US and Indian Markets</objective>
