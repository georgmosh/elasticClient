  <objective>Nowadays more and more efforts are made to make the road traffic safer. Not just for the cars and trucks, but also for the
motorbikes. The European Commission passed a legislation in 2012 that made the fitment of ABS for all new motorcycles
above 125cc to be mandatory from 1 January 2016. This clearly demonstrates the trend that two wheeled vehicles must
follow. The importance of reliable and effective breaking is also important for bicycles and electronic bikes (e-bikes) whose
popularity is constantly growing filling the gap between motorcycles and pedal bikes.
We are VIDRASOFT a spin-off company of University of Pannonia established in 2002, specialized in automotive
electronics, automotive mechatronics and automotive informatics. To reflect this trend in 2 wheeled transport safety we have
developed a game changing hydraulic type anti-lock braking system (ABS) for bicycle applications and have protected it with
a patent. The functionality of the prototype system has been verified on several real road surface conditions (such as dry and
wet asphalt, gravel and dirt roads) in a relevant environment (TRL6). This clearly demonstrates that we are ready for
commercialization.
Regarding the market size, over 191 Million pedal bikes produced a year world-wide and it is estimated that by 2018 the
global e-bike sales will be close to 50 Million. This clearly demonstrates that the market is huge. Based on our pre-feasibility
market findings we are initially targeting race and premium segment of pedal bikes as well as e-bikes. According to our initial
business projection we estimate at least 3.9 Mâ‚¬ profit in 5 year time after market entry.</objective>
