  <objective>GreenLight® is a ground-breaking new instrument / kit consumable platform to measure microbiological contamination, developed by international experts in the field of fluorescent oxygen sensing technology. This easy to use, reagent-free detection system is so sensitive, that a single bacteria cell can be measured in hours; rather than days using current agar plate methods. GreenLight® is the first system to market that can be used end to end through the supply chain (from farm to fork). The unique sensor chemistry in the APCheck™ sensor vial, which is the core consumable of every GreenLight® assay, allows contamination to be detected in any food or beverage product. 

The PROTECTDAIRY-F2F innovation business solution, leverages an existing international distribution network to realise €14m / 5 year new vial sales from launch in the dairy microbiology testing market, and position GreenLight® for future growth targeting a 5% share of the much larger €2.5bn food and beverage testing market. To achieve these sales, we will optimise and scale vial manufacture, to ensure competitive pricing of €2.50 per test while maintaining a 40% profit margin at high volumes. We will position GreenLight® as the microbiology testing platform of choice for the dairy industry, by integrating a complete suite of approved test applications, together with real-time traceability, trend analysis, early warning and alert across the entire supply chain.</objective>
