  <objective>Plastic is today the 3rd material produced and global production has skyrocketed: from 1.5Mt in 1950 to 322Mt in 2015. But only 5% of worldwide produced plastic is today recycled, being one of the least recycled material. Plastic wastes that are not recycled are called Ultimate scrap residues and come mostly from End-of-life vehicles (ELV) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). Today, companies producing Ultimate scrap residue have two options to discharge this waste: 1) Landfill disposal where they must pay a considerable fee (120€/t in 2015) with a strong environmental impact but this practice is expected to be soon banned in Europe; 2) selling and sending the wastes to Asia (mostly in China) at a price of 250€/ton but with the requirement of investing in expensive pre-treatment systems and with also negative environmental impact. Our TRIBOSORT technology is a unique solution that allows to 1) recycle all ultimate scrap residues from ELV and WEEE, 2) separate its valuable plastic components with a purity of 95% minimum, 3) provide an industrial scale solution with a production capacity of 1.5t/h, 4) produce a final recycled plastic material directly marketable to manufacturers, 5) provide a Recycle certificate along with our final products. APR2 is an experienced SME with 2.6M€ turnover and over 15 years in the plastic recycling market collecting, sorting and dismantling WEEE (over 5Kt treated every year) thanks to our 5,000m2 of exploitation area, 5 dismantling workshops, and 15 approved provider partners to recycle their wastes with recycling rate between 85 and 90%. APR2 has been awarded of many renown prices for its constant investment in R&amp;D (10% annual du CA). Our first TRIBOSORT prototype design obtained a worldwide PCT Patent (WO 2010/109096 A1) and has been today delivered in 7 countries and pending in 2 further countries. We are certified “Adapted Company” (&gt; of 80% handicapped persons employed), ISO 9001, 14001 and 50001.</objective>
