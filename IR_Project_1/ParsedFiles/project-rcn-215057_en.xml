  <objective>Among those food plants that eventually became domesticated, faba bean played a major role; the species has one of the longest established traditions of cultivation, having been domesticated more than ten thousand years ago and is a staple resource in many countries. 
The process of co-evolution between faba bean and human beings developed over millennia and therefore needs to be investigated from a long-term perspective. Unfolding the past will allow us to understand the present situation and could lead to future actions to more effectively increase the resistance of faba bean to environmental stresses and pests and reduce the risk of famine for the human beings living in developing countries. 
Within the context of this project, we intend to combine two of the most innovative methods available to archaeobotanists, Shape Analysis and Stable Carbon Isotopes Analysis.  The combined use of these methods will allow us to identify the varieties of faba bean used by the early farmers and assess the ecological requirements of the primitive forms of faba bean. In addition, to solve the enigma of the origin of the crop, the information obtained with this project will serve as a basis for agronomists and plant breeders to search the genome of primitive landraces for useful mutations that can improve the resistance of faba bean to drought and pests.</objective>
