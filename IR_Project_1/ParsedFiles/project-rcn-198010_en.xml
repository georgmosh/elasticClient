  <objective>Buiding on our highly successful SME Instument Phase 1 Project, The Smart Actuator Company Ltd develops smart, RIFT Driven® actuators. Our first was delivered to market in Q3-2013.  

The system is proven to use 25% less copper, be 80% lighter and 75% more energy efficient than our competitors.  Early success means that the first two years production scheduling is already sold to 90% capacity and The Smart Actuator Company now own global rights for the use of RIFT Technology in electrically powered actuators.  

Put simply, we believe our technology is a game changing product capable of delivering benefits worldwide by dramatically reducing:

• Energy required to automate everyday tasks in many applications.
• Volume of raw materials, including copper and magnets, used to manufacture automated systems.
• Inventory and therefore administration complexity.
• Weight, thereby reducing fuel use in logistics and shipping.
• Carbon Footprint in manufacturing and distribution.
• Need for sourcing manufacturing capability outside Europe.</objective>
