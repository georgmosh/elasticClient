  <acronym>LiVoX</acronym>
  <objective>LiVoX will make our NMR microchip sensor market-ready for novel applications such as foodstuff testing, compound screening for example on cell-based assays, or biopsy monitoring for hospitals. By turning NMR sensors into consumables, LiVoX will achieve a paradigm shift that will open up these new markets.
We are convinced that the sensors will be readily accepted by the market, since they already work with established and installed NMR hardware, and provide dramatically increased NMR measurement sensitivity.
LiVoX will take a mass-producible NMR microchip sensor that is currently at technology readiness level (TRL) 6 at a university laboratory, and scale up the manufacturing towards wafer-scale mass production, by outsourcing the majority of the manufacturing steps. LiVoX will implement quality control procedures for production and sensor function, and will perform extensive beta testing at application sites, to drive the microchip sensors right up to commercialisation readiness at TRL 9.
It is the clear goal of LiVoX to transfer the microchip sensor manufacturing process to a startup company at the end of this one year ramp-up period. LiVoX will remove the last barriers that remain for introduction of the microchip sensors into the marketplace.</objective>
