  <objective>The growing population is putting a strain on the world’s water resources while at the same time the ever-developing industrialization is causing increasing occurences of water-contamination, both in potable water sources and in wastewater, which is discharged into rivers and oceans.
To deal with these issues of water contamination, 

Mycometer has developed an automatic early-warning solution, the BactiLine at-line system, which promptly detects elevated levels of bacteria in water systems and sends out a warning when bacteria presence is above tolerated limits. BactiLine can be implemented at main control points in the distribution system, sample the water quality at pre-determined intervals and report to a control database.

The BactiLine system is based on the existing and patented Bactiquant®-water method, which measures the total bacteria presence in a water sample by use of a sensitive fluorescence technology
For end-users the BactiLine solution presents the following benefits: 

i.	Faster response time, as water is sampled several times a day and bacteria counts are reported within minutes of the sampling

ii.	Larger sample sizes, with bacteria concentrated through filtration, minimizes the risk of false positives.

iii.	Improved possibility for remote water quality monitoring through automated sampling from the water source

iv.	More resource-efficient sampling process with the elimination of manual work hours for lab technician

v.	The assay sensitivity can be adjusted in real time, allowing the 

technology to be used in a broad range of water types and applications
With the BactiLine system, Mycometer will target utilities companies, wastewater treatment plants and industrial plants using large amounts of water for production processes, leading to a sales revenue of €7.2M, five years post project.</objective>
