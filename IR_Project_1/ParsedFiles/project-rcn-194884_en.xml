  <acronym>SpeechXRays</acronym>
  <objective>The SpeechXRays project will develop and test in real-life environments a user recognition platform based on voice acoustics analysis and audio-visual identity verification. SpeechXRays will outperform state-of-the-art solutions in the following areas:
• Security: high accuracy solution (cross over accuracy1 of 1/100 ie twice the commercial voice/face solutions) 
• Privacy: biometric data stored in the device (or in a private cloud under the responsibility of the data subject)
• Usability: text-independent speaker identification (no pass phrase), low sensitivity to surrounding noise
• Cost-efficiency: use of standard embedded microphone and cameras (smartphones, laptops)
The project will combine and pilot two proven techniques: acoustic driven voice recognition (using acoustic rather than statistical only models) and multi-channel biometrics incorporating dynamic face recognition (machine vision analysis of speech, lip movement and face).
The vision of the SpeechXRays project is to provide a solution combining the convenience and cost-effectiveness of voice biometrics, achieving better accuracies by combining it with video, and bringing superior anti-spoofing capabilities.
The technology will be deployed on 2000 users in 3 pilots: a workforce use case, an eHealth use case and a consumer use case. 
The project lasts 36 months and is coordinated by world leader in digital security solutions for the mobility space.</objective>
