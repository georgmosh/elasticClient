  <objective>In this Marie Sklodowska-Curie action we explore the prospects of controlled multi-photon scattering processes as a probe of the nonlinear interactions and the dynamics of complex open quantum systems. The core of the project builds around the development of novel analytical and numerical tools to model complex scattering processes under correlated noise and dissipation. The project is thus mainly theoretical, but it is also interdisciplinary and focuses on problems and setups that admit immediate experimental implementations in a variety of state-of-the-art platforms, such as superconducting qubits coupled to microwave photons in transmission lines or quantum emitters coupled to photonic crystal waveguides. Moreover, the techniques and ideas that we will develop should be essential for the understanding and control of light-matter interactions in the multi-photon regime, as well as for the engineering and modelling of new and robust photon-based quantum technologies.</objective>
