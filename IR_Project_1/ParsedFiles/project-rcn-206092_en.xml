  <objective>The project analyses the market structures and drivers, obstacles and opportunities from scientific, technical, legal, ethical, governance and socioeconomic vantage points. The analysis is grounded in economic and political science theories on how service markets with public and private features can develop, and how innovations may succeed. The consortium offers a good cross-section of representation from various vantage points in the climate services market, complemented by expert knowledge on market research and innovation policy. The consortium has excellent connections to many climate service user types and other stakeholders. The study will engage a large diversity of stakeholders in many ways, especially through the explorative market development exercises employing different co-design approaches. Next to reporting based analysis of market functioning and solutions, the protocols developed in the explorative market development exercises are meant for replication at large scale.</objective>
