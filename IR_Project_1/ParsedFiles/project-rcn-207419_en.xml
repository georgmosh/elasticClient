  <acronym>BioCHANGE</acronym>
  <objective>Biodiversity CHANGE is a major, but still underappreciated, threat to humanity. It arises when there is unprecedented turnover in the identities of species that comprise ecological assemblages. To understand, monitor and ameliorate this CHANGE, and to enable appropriate societal responses, policy makers and conservation managers urgently need access to the best possible data. At present the ability of practitioners to elucidate ecosystem responses to anthropogenic impacts is hampered by data availability. Building on ERC AdvG BioTIME, BioCHANGE will provide a proof of concept that existing fragmented data can be assembled into an open access, authoritative database to form a crucial resource for addressing societal challenges arising from the biodiversity crisis.</objective>
