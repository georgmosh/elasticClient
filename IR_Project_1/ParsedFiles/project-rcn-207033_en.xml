  <objective>Mental disorders and neurological conditions affect to at least 20% of worldwide population during lifetime. NESPLORA has developed a new ICT system for the evaluation of a range of mental disorders, called “VRMIND”, based on the use of virtual reality (VR) environments. This technology is characterised by the ability to develop, clinically validate and perform innovative diagnosis procedures that simply cannot be done up to now. The patient, wearing virtual reality glasses and headphones, is introduced in different virtual environments specifically designed to diagnose a family of mental disorders. These virtual environments put the patient through multiple expected and unexpected stimuli, propose to execute different actions and ask to respond different questions. At the same time the system monitors the reactions of the patient and registers multiple variables.</objective>
