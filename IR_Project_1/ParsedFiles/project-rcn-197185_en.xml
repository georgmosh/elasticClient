  <acronym>4M</acronym>
  <objective>The main goal of this project is the development of an industrial “plug &amp; play” system for additive layer manufacturing which is based on a blown powder process using Plasma Transferred Arc (PTA) Technology. The developed 4M System will offer:
a)	Simple equipment concept based on well established PTA technology for hard facing coatings
b)	Possibility to realize Multi-Material concepts
c)	Suitability of the technology to be used for a wide range of raw materials 
d)	High deposition/building rates
e)	Possibility to realize large size components (up to 1,5 m x 1,5 m in the first version)
Within the project the system will be developed to be used for wo different materials (Al and Ti-alloys) and to demonstrate one multi-material concept. The developed process will be used to realize three different demonstrators (case studies) and to perform testing of the manufactured prototypes under space relevant testing conditions.</objective>
