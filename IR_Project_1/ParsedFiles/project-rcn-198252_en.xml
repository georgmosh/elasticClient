  <objective>The overall aim is to ensure that Scottish SMEs with international innovation and growth ambitions are empowered by unlocking their full growth  potential through better internal innovation management capability.

The underpinning objective of this proposal is therefore to  deliver a quality  service in Scotland that supports SMEs to increase their innovation management capacity and to innovate successfully and profitably.   This requires not only a focused SME targeting strategy, but also qualified staff trained on appropriate tools and methodologies, delivering the right  support to the right SMEs, coordinated with other delivery teams with the Enterprise Europe Network Scotland (EES) host organisations.</objective>
