Worldwide demand for thermosetting powder coatings has increased over the last few decades based on their well-known characteristics such as excellent durability and finish, easy application and low environmental impact. The most important thermosetting resins in the powder coating market are epoxies and polyester, which cure between 180ยบ and 200ยบC depending on the combination and the cross linker used. Epoxies are preferred for their overall physical properties, while polyesters exhibit better outdoor weathering properties.</objective>
