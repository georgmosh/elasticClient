  <objective>With excellence in research, innovation, and application into economy and society, the new Centre of Excellence, Renewable materials and healthy environments research and innovation centre of excellence (InnoRenew CoE) will improve sustainable building practices by combining the existing concepts with the Restorative Environmental Design (RED) paradigm, which combines sustainable building practices with biophilic design. This will increase the competitive advantages of the affiliated renewable resource-based construction industry, and create innovation and market pull for RED-based materials and products (holistic living environment). Consequently, innovation and market pull for material recovery and higher added value renewable resource based and energy carriers will be initiated. Research and development activities will seek the optimal intersection of performance and sustainability, including economic, environmental and societal indicators. With support and guidance from the advanced partner, Fraunhofer WKI, scientific research and development activities will be transferred profitably and efficiently to the industry and through them to society in the form of innovative new products and processes.</objective>
