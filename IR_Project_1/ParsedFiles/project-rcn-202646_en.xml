  <objective>The innovative concept of the ERC Starting Grant project “Keratinocytes and Matrix metalloproteinases: driving force of skin wound contraction?” was to use inhalants for skin wounds and it proved to be excellent and functional. Surface Modulation of Wounds (SUMOWO) with these anti-inflammatory, pro-migratory and anti-fibrotic compounds will be beneficial for chronic wound healing and reduce excessive scarring. This novel drug-based treatment strategy marks a novel era of wound care. A clinical phase 1 study on healthy volunteers is planned to show the product’s safety and tolerability for skin use – the first step towards clinical application. The goal of SUMOWO is to deliver clinical proof of concept, to provide a thorough market analysis with contact to key-players, to secure our intellectual property rights on an international platform, to accelerate commercial exploitation and ultimately, to restore patients’ life quality.</objective>
