  <objective>Growing road traffic in Europe results in detrimental effects on the environment and public health to a level that is becoming unsustainable, this in spite of increasingly stringent emission standards. In particular, CO2 and noxious emissions are not sufficiently reduced in real driving, while higher injection pressures have led to a shift towards the emission of smaller nanoparticles that are undetected by current certification procedures.

The challenge of the DiePeR project is to apply advanced technologies for combustion and exhaust aftertreatment to existing non-hybrid Diesel engines and to optimize the improved characteristics of a new generation of engines with regard to emissions, fuel consumption and driveability. Specific technologies will be advanced to TRL 6 or TRL 7 and integrated in two demonstration vehicles: One passenger car of the mid/ premium segment and one light commercial vehicle. A full calibration and assessment of the vehicles and underlying technologies will take place to proof: Real driving emissions substantially below Euro 6/ NEDC limits, less than half of emitted particles (number) including particles &lt; 23nm and a more than 5% improved fuel efficiency based on best-in-class MY2015 vehicles. The project also addresses design features, control and basic research such as modelling of particles formation and the deterioration of engine components (fuel injection system, exhaust aftertreatment system) and its effect on emissions, in order to assess the robustness of the vehicles over useful lifetime.</objective>
