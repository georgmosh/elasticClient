  <objective>CYBERWISER.EU pragmatically addresses, in the DS-07-2017 call, the urgent need to count on highly-skilled, multi-disciplined cybersecurity professionals, given the increasingly aggressive cyber-landscape that Europe and the world is facing. CYBERWISER.EU will be an educational, collaborative, real-time civil cyber range platform where cybersecurity competitions will take place, making it the EUâ€™s reference, authoritative, independent cybersecurity platform for professional training. Users can play the role of attackers and/or defenders in different scalable and configurable scenarios, composed of a set of virtual resources representing a company ICT infrastructure.
The platform will be completely web-based, to facilitate adoption, collaborative support from end-users and continuous upgrade. CYBERWISER.EU expands and builds on the results and users community of the H2020 IA named WISER [2015-2017], thereby providing a jump-start situation from a consolidated raising awareness and past investment point of view.
The 9 domain-skilled partners from 7 European Countries bring relevant assets to the project and are complementary and include 3 full-scale pilots (2 of which in critical infrastructures), viz.: 1. energy distribution; 2. railroad transport; 3. High Education, in the specific context of a University Master course on cybersecurity. An influential Stakeholder Expert Board (SEB) supports the consortium.
Main Outputs: An Innovative, fully integrated cyber range platform; economic risk models attack patterns with mitigation measures; specialised training documentation with methodology; 3 Full-scale Pilots; one Open Pilot Stream targeting 500+ individuals from at least 5 different verticals; 750+ trained professionals; Sustainability model &amp; business plan. High visibility through 4 workshops, 2 hackathons, 6 webinars, presence at 50+ specialised events. Profiled database of 2000+ records from 11 stakeholder groups.</objective>
