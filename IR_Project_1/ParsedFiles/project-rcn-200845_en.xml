  <objective>The “FeelSpeech” project will provide proof of concept of a novel prosthesis that will allow people with hearing loss to better understand speech. The prosthesis will be worn on the wrist and will resemble a wristwatch. A special, novel kind of tactile stimulation called “microstroking” provided by the device will supplement what a person hears, and this information will be unconsciously made use of by the user’s brain, providing improved speech perception even when the user has almost lost all hearing.</objective>
