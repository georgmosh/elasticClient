  <objective>The trend for more electrified automotive applications (MEAA) asks for a new generation of automotive electrical actuation systems, allowing for a more efficient and environmentally friendly mobility and enhancing the driving experience, making it safer, more comfortable and sustainable. 
INTERACTâ€™s overall objective is to answer the further enhancement of the next generation high-performance sustainable automotive electric actuators (SAEA) by combining high-level scientific research and training activities in a joint academia-industry doctoral programme, focused on solving critical issues (See Section 1.1.2) of the automotive electrical actuation Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) cycle. 
The project is a natural continuation of a fruitful collaboration between the beneficiaries: two universities (UTCN and ULB) and three industrial actors. What started as staff exchange collaboration for technological know-how and transfer of knowledge in the field of electrical machines and drives for automotive applications ,   is now developed, through INTERACT, into a joint doctoral programme, based on common interests and goals, in the field of R&amp;D of next generation of SAEA. More specifically, INTERACT takes advantage of the well-established intersectoral collaboration achievements and of the solid research and training competences and facilities at the beneficiaries for: (i) giving new career perspectives and increasing the employability of four young researchers, by enhancing their creative and innovative potential; (ii) pushing forward and/or extend the industrial partners portfolio with new technological developments to be integrated into the R&amp;D process so they remain and/or enter as an important player in automotive industry ; (iii) strengthen innovation capacity of UTCN and ULB with commercial exploitation of the research.</objective>
