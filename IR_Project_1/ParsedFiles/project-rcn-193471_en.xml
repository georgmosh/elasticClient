  <objective>The overall objective of BRESAER project is to design, develop and demonstrate an innovative, cost-effective, adaptable and industrialized envelope system for buildings refurbishment including combined active and passive pre-fabricated solutions integrated in a versatile lightweight structural mesh:
‒ Dynamic window with automatic and controlled air-tightness and insulated solar blinds complementing energy saving and visual comfort strategies, such as light redirection and response to solar radiation.
‒ Multifunctional and multilayer insulation panels made of Ultra High Performance Fibre Reinforced Concrete to be used as rigid shells integrating an insulation material.
‒ Combined solar thermal air and PV envelope component for indoor space heating and ventilation, thermal insulation and electricity generation.
‒ Multifunctional lightweight ventilated façade module.
‒ BIPV and Combined thermo-reflexive (improving fire resistance) and self-cleaning coating (through photo-catalytic nanoparticles).
The building will be governed by an innovative BEMS covering a specific control system for governing the envelope, the energy use of the building and the strategies for the electrical energy storage.
A real demonstration will be performed in an education building in Turkey. Four additional virtual demonstrations will be done in using real building in other European countries covering complementary climatic zones, constructed before the EPBD requirements were enacted.
Expected impact:
‒ Energy demand reduction for space heating and cooling 30,7% due to envelope refurbishment.
‒ Contribution solar thermal for space conditioning of 37,3%.
‒ Contribution of RES for electricity of 12,8%.
‒ The combination gives a total primary energy consumption reduction of 76,4%.
‒ Improved indoor environment quality by improving thermal, acoustics, illumination comfort and IAQ by reducing VOCs.
‒ Provide solutions with a pay-back time below 7 years.
‒ Validation and market uptake of active building elemen.</objective>
