  <acronym>FLIRT</acronym>
  <objective>The FLIRT proposes a project that is based on the idea that falling in love with science is just as exciting as falling in love with a real person, and shows how a passionate “crush” can develop into real love.

Massive awareness campaign will include continuous coverage and media sponsorship of tens of media outlets, visits to schools, and a development complex interactive RN Community Hub. 

The RN activities will address to different target groups – the most important being youth aged 13 to 19. It will offer a wide range of indoor and outdoor activities, lasting from early afternoon until midnight, for different age groups, and a variety of personal tastes and interests. All of the activities will, however, evolve around the central point of the event – and that is Love. 

The project team will undertake a comprehensive impact assessment, aimed at measuring the baseline data indicating the public recognition of research and researchers in Serbia, and the popularity of scientific careers, and then measuring any changes that might occur over the course of the project.</objective>
