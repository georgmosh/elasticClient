  <objective>Coastal oceans are essential to our societies but their health status is degrading rapidly in many parts of the world. Anticipating or remedying environmental evolutions/degradations, including those resulting from global changes, is particularly difficult. This is largely because the knowledge and information we currently have on the ocean functioning do not encompass scales finer than a few tens of kilometers, which is notably insufficient close to shores. WACO will clarify the role of fine-scale processes (turbulent and wave processes with scales &lt; 10 km) in the present-day functioning and future evolutions of the West African coastal dynamics and biogeochemistry. To do so, it will take advantage of a new generation of ocean models that is truly apt to simulate coastal dynamics/biogeochemistry/ecosystems in a fully integrated and multi-scale manner. Precisely, the project will be focused on the senegalese and mauritanian coastal oceans from which state-of-the-art ocean observations are available to complement and evaluate the modelling effort, a robust and interdisciplinary collaborative framework, and unmatched opportunities for social benefits of the research. The project relies on a massively parallel computing plan that will serve as a demanding training ground for the applicant. Overall WACO will contribute to a deeper understanding of climate change, which is a key goal of EU research.</objective>
