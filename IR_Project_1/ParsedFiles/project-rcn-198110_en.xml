  <objective>The ‘Humanities at Scale’ project will further the DARIAH ERIC’s aim to integrate digitally enabled research in the arts and humanities in Europe and beyond and to operate a platform to enable trans-national arts and humanities research. The project will help DARIAH sustain existing knowledge in digital arts and humanities in Europe and enable new one. DARIAH connects various hubs of excellence in the domain and helps them share their results and innovations. By sharing knowledge, DARIAH works proactively to enhance the reach of digital arts and humanities within the European Research Area (ERA). This proposals aims to address some critical limitations of the current model of sharing knowledge in DARIAH and of connecting the national services in digital arts and humanities initiatives in Europe.</objective>
