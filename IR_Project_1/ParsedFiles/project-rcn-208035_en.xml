  <objective>The My Impact Portal offered by C-Change is a a portfolio management tool for corporate teams to capture, share, and accelerate all company-wide Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), sustainability, and global impact initiatives.

Its overall goal is to address the issues of businesses struggling with purpose-driven management, a failing market system and lack of transparency for CSR. With this portal, businesses are better provided to play a transformative role in global society and deliver on the UN-SDG and Paris Agreement mandates.

My Impact Portal is based on a paradigm shift from fragmented social impact data towards shared network functionalities that can be applied to any Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). The portal is an easy to use scalable LinkedIn like tool that brings all scattered inter-company data and activities to one intranet portal, and connects this data and activities to external open, public, private, NGO and other SDG-related platforms, based on a set of objective metrics, verification methods, and taxonomy.

The objective for this SMEInst Phase 1 feasibility study is to develop a roll-out and business plan to launch the corporate B2B proposition in Europe and beyond.</objective>
