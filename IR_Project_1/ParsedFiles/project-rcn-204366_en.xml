  <acronym>bioburner</acronym>
  <objective>bioburner is the answer to the market to use biomass on industries with uninterrupted heating needs and strict production times.
We have developed a hybrid dual burner that combines the best of two technologies on a single burner, avoiding the problems associated with them, with a payback &lt; 1 year.
On the one hand biomass:
- pros: low cost of operation and neutral CO2 emissions;
- cons: high inertia, which means stop/start times very high;
On the other, fossil:
- pros: instantaneous response time and already present in most installations;
- cons: high OPEX and CO2 emissions;
bioburner is compact, safe, plug and play, scalable, cost-effective, efficient, reducing thermal energy cost by 50%, reliable, being able to operate automatically with two fuels and sustainable, reducing CO2 emissions by 95%.</objective>
