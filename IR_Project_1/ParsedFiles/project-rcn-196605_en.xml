  <acronym>EFFECTIVE</acronym>
  <objective>The EFFECTIVE project foresees the following objectives:
• analyse business trends and market prospects, and perform reviews &amp; workshops to get a consistent set of information for clustering and exploitation of FoF projects activities and results;
• develop and industrial exploitation framework for the promotion and transfer of FoF projects activities and results, and structure networks &amp; alliances to achieve such objectives;
• active clustering of FoF activities and results based the identification of six major technological FoF areas, addressing also potential sectors and applications for exploitation and transfer of the considered clusters of technologies;
• analyse best practices and case studies of FoF results clustering, exploitation and transfer through 4 relevant regional case studies in low-, medium- and high-technology intensive sectors, by means of the involvement of innovation actors of the considered regions;
• set up instruments for adequate monitoring of FoF activities clustering and exploitation during the project life-time and beyond, to ensure an effective implementation at programme level;
• identification of future FoF priorities within the technological areas of the addressed clusters and roadmapping of needed further research and innovation actions;
• promote and disseminate the EFFECTIVE project results and tools to a large community of European actors through qualified networks and associations (such as EFFRA, Enterprise Europe Network, EBN and EURADA);
• involve international experts and create strategic links with international initiatives to support the full achievement of EFFECTIVE objectives on global scale.</objective>
