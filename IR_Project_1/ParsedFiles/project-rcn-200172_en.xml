  <objective>This project aims at building a new versatile platform for quantum engineering of light, with the unique ability to create deterministic coherent photon-photon interactions tunable in range, strength and dimensionality. It will explore a new avenue towards this goal, combining cutting-edge advances of atomic physics with ideas inspired by nanophotonics: a cold micro-structured gas of interacting atoms will act as a Bragg mirror saturable by a single photon, strongly coupling a controlled number of spatial modes in an optical resonator. This flexible, efficient, dynamically-controlled system will be used to test the limits of fundamental no-go theorems in quantum logic, measure physical quantities inaccessible to standard detectors, and deterministically engineer massively entangled light beams for Heisenberg-limited sensing. Ultimately, it will give access to a yet unexplored regime where intracavity photons form a strongly correlated quantum fluid, with spatial and temporal dynamics ideally suited to perform real-time, single-particle-resolved simulations of non-trivial topological effects appearing in condensed-matter systems.</objective>
