  <objective>HomyHub GARAGE is a “plug and play device” for garage openers that turns any Smartphone into a smart garage remote control. Allowing users to control, monitor, and manage the access to their garage, anywhere and at anytime from their smartphone.In this 6 months project we are focusing on finding new business partners in EU countries and finalise our prototype, to make it commercial viable product. The main objective of our SME1 project is to gain proof of evidence that HomyHub’s product can be commercialized at a full speed from 2018 . For this, we have identified two important challenges to commercially fully exploit HomyHub’s product: 1) Our ambition is to become a worldwide leader in IoT devices for garage access. HomyHub is a young, fastly growing startup that is revolutionizing the world of smart mobility through delivering cutting edge technologies for garage access control. HomyHub has a balanced and very competitive founding team from Spain with strong IoT background: more than 40 years combined experience in Hardware, Firmware, Software and Business development. Our goal: to make a global business plan through the implementation of a feasibility study in this proposed Phase 1 (SMEi-1), to reach an international business uptake.</objective>
