  <objective>The “Easy Reading” framework will improve the cognitive accessibility of original digital documents by providing real time personalisation through annotation (using e.g. symbol, pictures, videos), adaptation (using e.g. layout, structure) and translation (using e.g Easy-to-Read, Plain Language, symbol writing systems). The framework provides these (semi-)automated services using HCI techniques (e.g. pop-ups/ Text-To-Speech (TTS)/captions through mouse-over or eye-tracking) allowing the user to remain and work within the original digital document. This fosters independent access and keeps the user in the inclusive discourse about the original content. Services adapt to each user through a personal profile (sensor based tracking and reasoning of e.g. the level of performance, understanding, preferences, mood, attention, context and the individual learning curve). 
The interdisciplinary project team includes users with cognitive disabilities in all phases through the Inclusive Participatory Action Research Method (IPAR) ensuring to address real users´ needs.
The “Easy Reading” framework is planned as a cloud based, open source and freely available support infrastructure. It will reach as many people with limited reading and language skills (e.g. people with cognitive disabilities - ~2,5% of the population - older adults, people with a different mother tongue) summing up to 25% in some regions or countries. Additionally, many more people will enjoy exploring new and unfamiliar content using personalised access. 
This framework integrates and supports state-of-the-art and future R&amp;D. It incorporates tools for annotation, adaptation and translation of content by providing a sustainable user-centred eco-system for personalisation. It promotes European ideals and enables independent applications to leverage the infrastructure and socialize their application for business (profit and non-for profit) in a new EU driven growth market.</objective>
