  <objective>“Pro-Membrane” is an extensive project which has been structured to face multiple tasks of different levels of innovation and risk. In its longest-term and most ambitious goal, Pro-Membrane, aims to face the still not solved challenge of stabilize and crystallize Membrane-Proteins (MPs). This study will use, as innovative tool, well-ordered and disordered functionalizable amphiphilic peptoids  for structural determinations.  Peptoids could indeed succeed where other classes of molecules previously failed, answering to the pressing need of a new method able to establish the specific interactions to stabilize and crystallize each MP. Their peculiar nature helps them to easily cross the membrane and their modular synthesis give access to an infinite combination of molecules. Despite their interest, a systematic and comparative study of their physical properties and self-assembly capacity was never done before. The multidisciplinarity of this work, between Organic Chemistry, Biophysics, and Structural Biology will be achieved through a strict collaboration between all the participants. Training through research and implementation activities have been planned to maximize the candidate’s profile in order to support his career perspectives.</objective>
