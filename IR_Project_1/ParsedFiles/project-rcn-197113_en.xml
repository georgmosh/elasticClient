  <objective>Multiscaled structure-tuned materials with exactly predefined hierarchical architectures composed of multifunctional nanoparticles represent a class of the most advanced future materials for applications in nanobiotechnology, nanomedicine, lighting technologies, green energy resources as well as in military and security branches. The CxI Centre in Liberec will expand its current activities in the field of nanomaterials and engineering technologies by integrating  multiscaled 3D-printing machines combined with wet nanochemistry robotics in order to create the aforementioned breakthrough materials. These activities fully correspond to the agenda defined in Horizon 2020. The project belongs to the CEP themes of composite materials (JI), biotechnology (EI) and non-nuclear energy, consumption and utilization of energy (JE).</objective>
