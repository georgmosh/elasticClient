  <objective>To pave the way forward for IS as a solution for more efficient processing and energy systems for the
process industry, we will develop a secure ICT platform (SHAREBOX) for the flexible management of 
shared process resources that will provide plant operations and production managers with the 
robust and reliable information that they need in real-time in order to effectively and confidently 
share resources (plant, energy, water, residues, and recycled materials) with other companies in a 
symbiotic eco-system. 

A suite of new analysis and optimisation tools for flexible energy use and material flow integration 
will be developed for optimising symbiosis among companies. These tools will be based on input-
output (IO) modelling for resource (waste and energy) supply-demand matching and process 
efficiency analysis (to understand physical and technological conditions), game theoretical (GT) 
approach for integrating company behaviour in cost-, benefit-, and resource-sharing (to understand 
economic conditions), and agent-based modelling (ABM) for designing the (economic, 
environmental, and social) optimal symbiotic network (to have the holistic optimum). The outputs 
from the SHAREBOX controller will provide plant and operations managers with commands for 
actions to be taken and/or recommendations for decision support. It will be ensured that all 
commands and recommendations a) fulfil plant operations requirements, b) are within the 
constraints of any contractual obligations, c) are in compliance with all regulatory thresholds, and d) 
deliver optimal impacts in terms of cost/savings and ecological footprints. The historical data that is 
generated by the SHAREBOX platform will be processed by data mining tools that will provide the 
production/process BIG DATA for symbiotic shared resources optimisation. The platform will be co-
created, implemented and tested at 4 demo locations in EU, using realistic industrial streams and 
process conditions.</objective>
