  <objective>The INNOHEM project will develop and validate the first Complete Blood cell Count (CBC) haematology analyser including 5-part differential and reticulocytes (5-part analyser) for the decentralized, low-volume testing haematology market. Today, CBC tests are performed using either 3-part or 5-part analysers. The latter are growing in importance worldwide as they are able to provide much more detailed information about the medical condition of the patient. However, 5-part analysers are currently designed entirely for the high-volume testing market with complex, centralized laboratories equipped with large sample automation devices. Recognising market niche and a strong business opportunity, Boule will create a revolutionary point-of-care analyser that will provide reliable 5-part haematology results from a finger-stick blood sample. The new system will disrupt the existing marketplace by redefining the segment for the commercial application of 5-part analysers (from high-volume centralized testing to low-volume near-patient testing). 
The key need of physicians is the access to an easy-to-deploy analyser for 5-part CBC testing. The analyser should be designed for easy operation in smaller laboratory settings. The usersâ€™ needs will be met by creating a user-friendly diagnostic device that allows for low-volume, decentralized and near-patient testing. The Phase 1 project will develop a strategic business plan for the commercialisation of the new product. The Phase 2 project will validate the new diagnostic device. The EU added value will be generated by allowing physicians to make a rapid health assessment of the patient locally and take improved decisions concerning further diagnostic measures or immediate treatment strategy. This will ultimately lead to more personalized and cost-efficient approaches to healthcare on the EU level.</objective>
