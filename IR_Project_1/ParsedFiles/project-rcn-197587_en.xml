  <acronym>DRIVING RIG</acronym>
  <objective>This project involves the creation of a driving simulator for disabled people that can provide a scientific assessment of their driving skills and indicate the type of adaptation to be made to the vehicle. The product consists of three different components: a complex hardware device that assesses the driving context through sophisticated sensors, software that simulates various driving situations (sudden braking, queues, roundabouts, etc/) and a real-time analytics system that converts the series of measurements into a genuine medical/scientific assessment.</objective>
