  <acronym>CLARA</acronym>
  <objective>Climate variability and change (CVC) embody sizeable economic, social and environmental risks in Europe and globally . Climate services (CSs) (Brasseur and Gallardo, 2016; Brooks, 2013; Lourenco et al., 2015) are essential for catalysing economic and societal transformations that not only reduce these risks and/or improve societal resilience, but also unlock Europeâ€™s innovation potential, competitiveness and economic growth. As a part of European efforts to catalyse the potential of climate services for more efficient natural resource management and improved disaster risk management and resilience, the CLARA project will boost innovation and uptake of climate services based on front line seasonal and decadal forecasts and climate projections. Building upon the advancements in climate modelling and science in the context of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), the CLARA project will illustrate genuine benefits and economic value of CSs in the face of climate variability and short-term climate change. A portfolio of user co-designed and co-developed climate services will help to improve policy and decision makings in the five priority areas GFCS: disaster risk reduction, water resource management, agriculture and food (security), renewable energy sources, and public health. Carefully designed business and marketing strategies will promote their uptake, help to energise the European market with climate services, and foster the European innovation potential.</objective>
