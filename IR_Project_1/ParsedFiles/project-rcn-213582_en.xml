  <objective>The overall objective of the here proposed project “Housing Association’s Energy Efficiency Process Planning and Investments” (HAPPI) is to increase the energy renovation rate within the social housing sector using an exemplary action bringing together six social housing associations in the Danish municipality of Sonderborg. It will challenge the complex interplay of non-technological barriers (organizational, legal, financial) through a well-defined process and capacity building, leading ultimately to an aggregated 15,2 MEUR investment program (leverage factor 15,1) for sustainable energy measures in the associated building stock.

The total investment in energy efficiency will include 56 different departments of the six social housing organizations’ building stock, involving a total of 6,000 tenants in 3,318 homes, of which 2,100 are flats in storey buildings and 1,208 are terrace houses.

The investment launched by HAPPI is anticipated to lead to energy savings of 11,5 GWh/year, annual reductions of 1,640 tons CO2 eq. and the generation of 1.6 GWh/year of renewable energy.</objective>
