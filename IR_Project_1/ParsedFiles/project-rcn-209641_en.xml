  <acronym>ESCRT model</acronym>
  <objective>My project focuses on the characterization of the mechanism of action of ESCRT-III complex. ESCRTs are evolutionary conserved proteins which mediate membrane remodeling and scission in a variety of important cellular processes, and are implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including virus release and nuclear membrane repair during cancer cell migration. Despite intense research, many outstanding questions still remain unanswered, and all model proposed remain highly speculative. Based on our preliminary data, we propose a novel, unifying model for ESCRT-III function. The aim of the project is to provide solid data to support this model by an in vitro reconstitution approach, which would constitute a major contribution in the field. 
The concrete aims of my project are:

- Characterization of the minimal ESCRT-III fission machinery 
- Characterization of the molecular mechanism leading to membrane fission by ESCRT-III complex
- Characterization of the membrane requirements to obtain fission by ESCRT-III, in particular membrane curvature</objective>
