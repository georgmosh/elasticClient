  <objective>Through VIOTRAP project, the participating SME attempts to introduce a novel alternative to plants spraying as a means of pest control, in European and Global farming, covering a wide array of Diptera species.
In particular, VIOTRAP project objectives comprise the expansion of the trap technology currently used for mitigation and control of B. Olea, in order to be exploited for the control of other harmful Diptera species, such as C. capitata and D. suzukii.</objective>
