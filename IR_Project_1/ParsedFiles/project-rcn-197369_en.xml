  <objective>The end users of solvent based varnishes for High Vacuum Metallization (HVM) are since long searching for solutions at a lower environmental impact, unlocking full green growth potential, at the same performances level of current products.   Early results of independent research conducted from MARBO, permitted to foresee a true revolution in the sector, empowered by water-based formulation.  Technological Feasibility, Market Assessment, Business Models and Plans objectives of the Wave-Metal project are oriented to permit the implementation of the project results into real business cases.  
The benefits for MARBO, and for the whole European process industry, are associated to recovery of important business quotes and jobs.  A new line of products is expected to become the reference for a solvent-free chemistry, permitting an ambitious raise of MARBO share of the worldwide quota in the sector, from 2,7% to up to the 25% in the next 10 years.</objective>
