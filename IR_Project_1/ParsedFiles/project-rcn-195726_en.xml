  <objective>In the project of Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellowship, I will design a versatile molecular platform that is used to construct multifunctional amphiphiles, which co-assemble with amphiphilic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to form monodisperse and stable targeting drug delivery vesicles. By incorporating multiple targeting ligands and multiple hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, I aim to discover efficient vesicle formulation with increased targeting selectivity and potent cytotoxicity to tumor cells. The route of the targeted drug delivery will be followed spontaneously via transiting surface plasmon resonance of AuNPs, and the impact of the targeted drug delivery on the targeted tumor cells will be monitored in real time by live cell Raman micro-spectroscopy. Furthermore, any targeting ligand, hydrophilic and hydrophobic drug can be easily tuned for a variety of different targeted tumour cells.</objective>
