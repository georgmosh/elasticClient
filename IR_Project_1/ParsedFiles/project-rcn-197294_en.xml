  <objective>The continuously growing amount of photos posted and distributed over the Internet poses several important problems related to improper use of images, such as exploiting them for commercial purposes, re-posting others’ photos without consent or infringing copyright, posting photos containing unethical or illegal contents, and so forth. Camera identification, which refers to identifying which digital imaging sensor has shot a given picture, exploiting the fact that each sensor leaves a unique fingerprint in all pictures, is a key ingredient in the solution to the aforementioned problems. The ToothPic project aims at validating a breakthrough camera identification technology developed during ERC starting grant “CRISP”.  This technology is based on a novel compressed fingerprint format and outperforms state-of-the art techniques by orders of magnitude in terms of storage requirements and identification speed. As a consequence, it enables the deployment of camera-identification services on an unprecedented scale, paving the way for application to popular image sharing and social media sites. The proof-of-concept will consist in a very high-speed implementation of the camera identification core functionality, which will be used to validate the capability of the proposed technology to handle scenarios involving 100+ millions of sensor fingerprints, in real time and at a low cost. A set of demo applications, including a public search engine, taking as input a camera fingerprint or a photo and returning a list of photos acquired by the same camera, will also be implemented in order to raise a broad public interest and attract industries and venture capitalists. Upon successful validation, a European start-up company named “ToothPic” will be created to commercialise the proposed technology.</objective>
