  <objective>SMA currently manufacture a 4 cylinder air cooled diesel engine. It will render this product more competitive in the market place if it has a higher power output (+20%) and is lighter (10%). This proposal by Ilmor Engineering Ltd presents a program of work to achieve these objectives.

It is proposed to use start of the art analysis techniques and invent solutions for:-

a. Cooling the cylinder head.
b. Improved strength coupled with simplified assembly and manufacturing of the crankcase.
c. Improved layout of the engine with regard to the turbocharger position.</objective>
