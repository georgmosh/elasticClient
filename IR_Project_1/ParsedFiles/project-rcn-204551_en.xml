  <objective>This ERC Proof of Concept (PoC) Grants should maximize the value of the research performed in the funded ERC Coldnano project by establishing viability of the future industrial product, by solving technical issues concerning the laser systems, by clarifying IPR position and strategy and by budgeting commercial discussion between partners.

Industrialization of combined FIB and atom manipulation techniques of laser cooling require special knowledge that will be study by the PI with collaboration and subcontracting to private compagny having succeeded to bring at industrial level such laser techniques. 

At the end of this ERC PoC the goal is to end up with well-defined economical, commercial and exploitation plans and to have solved the main technical problems, to have solutions that should definitively allow us to realize a new FIB machine well optimized for the market.</objective>
