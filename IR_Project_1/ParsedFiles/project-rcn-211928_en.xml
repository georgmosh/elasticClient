  <objective>inBETWEEN goes beyond currently available ICT technologies used for inducing the end User behaviour change towards more energy efficient lifestyles by simultaneously assisting Users to IDENTIFY energy wastes, LEARN how they could conserve energy and MOTIVATE them to act. Apart from detecting energy saving opportunities and offering various incentives for Users’ behaviour change, great part of the motivation aspect will also be associated with the provided ability and means to act through inBETWEEN solution. The overarching technological objective which is to deliver cost-effective solution that brings added value, without significant disruption of everyday activities, through the collaborative inBETWEEN cloud based platform offering advance energy services. It allows Users to integrate their building’s connected devices and systems with advance energy analytics and optimisation services to create a comprehensive recommendation and feed-back solution which will facilitate further the behaviour change towards more energy and cost efficient daily routines. A significant demonstration activity in a range of real life pilot locations in EU with diverse public set-ups, which differ in terms of size, type, climate and patterns of use, will offer the necessary technology validation.</objective>
