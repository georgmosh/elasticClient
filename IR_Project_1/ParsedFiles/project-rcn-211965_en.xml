  <objective>The key aspects for this proposal, FR8HUB, is the emphasis on increasing the efficiency in the nodes, hubs and terminals in the railway system for freight and to continue development in freight locomotives of the future. FR8HUB answers to the member call for Shift2Rail IP5 AWP 17 and thereby propose activities in new development areas together with continuation of progress in Technical Demonstrators (TD) started in AWP 15. To succeed with implementation of technologies developed within Shift2Rail IP5, FR8HUB will also initiate development of a strategy for implementation of relevant technologies to secure market uptake.</objective>
