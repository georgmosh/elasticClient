  <objective>The increasing number of chronic patients in rheumatology calls for further development of the traditional methods for monitoring symptoms. The aim of the ELECTOR project is to develop a web-based ICT platform for home-based monitoring of self-reliant patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This will provide clinicians with a tool that can completely substitute a large proportion of the conventional visits at a rheumatologic outpatient clinic. 

The solution will encompass point-of-care devices for the measurement of biochemistry at home and a web-based user interface for reporting questionnaires as well as swollen and tender joints.

The end result is an eHealth solution that will provide an integrated and direct collection of data into patient notes in the setup of an e-Health clinic. This solution will constitute a reliable, safe and straightforward method for obtaining self-assessments and facilitate easy and rapid access to health care assistance at times of need for the individual patient.</objective>
