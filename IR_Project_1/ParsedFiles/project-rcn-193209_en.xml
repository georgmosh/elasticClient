  <objective>"""Party do not stop"" includes the proposal of two editions of the Researchers' Night to be carried out in Liguria in 2014 and 2015. 
The partnership of ""Party don't stop"" has decided to organize a big party where all citizens are invited on the 26th September 2014 and the 25th September 2015. The festival will take place in three cities, which together cover the entire coast of Liguria: Genoa, La Spezia and Albenga. The locations of the Night are of great interest to the general public and of great importance in the imagination of the population. The magnificent Villa Bombrini and its park in the district of Cornigliano (Genoa), the Port of Genoa, one of the main crossroads in the Mediterranean area, the Port of La Spezia, the ""Giardino Letterario Delfino"" (a literary garden in Albenga) and the downtown of Albenga.
The partners have focused the program of the Nights on a topic: ""The researchers change the world."" The activities aim at attracting and involving people of any age, origin, social and cultural background in a friendly way and researchers worked in order to fully involve little girls, teen girls and women and turn them into the protagonists of the events. We really do believe that the experiments, workshops, talks, observation of stars and of sea animals, contests, sports, skill, imagination and costume competitions, cooking courses and tests, theater performances and concerts, which are planned and proposed by researchers, will make "" Party do not stop "" and unforgettable experience for everyone.
