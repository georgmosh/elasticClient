  <acronym>SULIPRO</acronym>
  <objective>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition in which fat builds up in the liver causing inflammation and eventually lead to permanent scarring (cirrhosis), which can seriously impair the liverâ€™s ability to functions. NAFLD can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and then to liver failure resulting in death unless there is a liver transplant. The prevalence of NAFLD in Europe is estimated to be between 26 and 33% of the general population. Currently, there is no available therapeutic treatment for patients with NAFLD and NASH. Natural Shield have developed a specialised oral therapeutic, called SULIPRO, which is a combination of soy derived compounds, that has been proposed as a novel scientifically proven safe treatment for patients in the early stages of NAFLD and NASH.  Current drugs produced for liver diseases have a large amount of side effects and high financial costs that may preclude their long-term use in patients with NAFLD or the early stages of NASH. SULIPRO has already undergone positive clinical trials in animal models and successful Phase I clinical trials in humans showing demonstrating no side effects and high efficacy. The company now requires funding for a small Phase II trial. Once commercialised SULIPRO will be made available to consumers at an affordable price, as an over the counter (OTC) drug, available in shops/pharmacies and on the web, using an online distributor, such as Amazon. Natural Shield maintains its own research program involved in developing in parallel OTC food supplements, physician-prescribed medical foods, and FDA-approved botanical drugs. The company expects to reach the market with its first products within 24 months and thus far has raised over 5 million EUR in private funds.</objective>
