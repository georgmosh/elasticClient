  <objective>The BELLA-S1 proposal aims to provide for the long-term interconnectivity needs of the European and Latin American research and education networks, and answers the call for transatlantic connectivity to Latin America in the H2020 Work Programme 2014-15. The objective will be to strengthen connectivity to Latin America ensuring very high capacity, cost benefits and the shortest possible route, whilst stimulating diversity over the transatlantic segment. The objective will be met in two phases: phase one will procure an indefeasible right of use for a portion of the spectrum of a direct submarine telecommunications cable between Europe and Latin America; phase two will deploy one or more wavelengths, as required, on the spectrum procured to interconnect the GÃ‰ANT and RedCLARA networks, and provide for the intercontinental connectivity needs of the European and Latin American research and education communities.</objective>
