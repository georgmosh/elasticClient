  <acronym>IMPACT-2</acronym>
  <objective>This Project aims to perform the socio-economic Research for Shift2Rail, to develop the SPD Scenarios and the KPI integrated assessment. Smart Maintenance, Standardisation, Integrated Mobility Management and Human Ressources are cross-cutting activities of Shift2Rail as well and consequently topics of the Project, too. The objectives of this proposal IMPACT-2 are:
- Evaluating the effects for mobility, society and environment induced by new technology solutions and developments.
- Introducing relevant targets and needs to create a more attractive, a more competitive and more sustainable rail system.
- Defining System Platform Demonstrators (SPD) that represent future application use cases.
- Defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that enable the monitoring and assessment of the Shift2Rail overall target achievement.
- Smart Maintenance. 
- Prepare an efficient process for bringing Shift2Rail results into standardisation. 
- Develop a common platform for the intelligent mobility management.
- Human ressources. 
The project IMPACT-2 is planned to fulfil all respective topics of the Shift2Rail Annual Work Plan 2017.</objective>
