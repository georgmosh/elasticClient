  <objective>A national service in support of recipients of the H2020 SME Instrument and for the improvement of innovation management in SMEs, with the purpose of more companies with growth potential achieving global scaling 
 
Innovation is a vital ingredient of growth and an important element of the future success of the UK.  With some 95% of R&amp;D and innovation conducted outside of the UK and many major and lead market shaping companies being of non-UK origin, access to knowledge, markets, skills and partners is increasingly taking place on a global basis.  To ensure UK business stays competitive it is important that it is able to effectively access and exploit the growing global investment in research and innovation. 
 
Through EEN ENIW activities we will help businesses build collaborations and partnerships and access the finance, knowledge, skills, networks and customers to more rapidly move a concept through to commercialisation and to scale their business.</objective>
