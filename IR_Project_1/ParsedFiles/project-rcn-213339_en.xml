  <objective>ScanVid’s vision is to essentially disrupt the retail market through facilitating consumer’s access to integrated digital information about products, across all phases of the retail lifecycle including pre-sales and after-sales activities. The goal of the proposed SME Instrument Ph. 1 (feasibility study) project (i.e. ScanVidStart) is to perform a technical and business validation of the developed prototype in operational conditions and with the active engagement of a large retailer within established presence worldwide. Along with the successful completion of the feasibility study, the project will systematically study IPR issues, while preparing a detailed business plan for market launch at a global scale.</objective>
