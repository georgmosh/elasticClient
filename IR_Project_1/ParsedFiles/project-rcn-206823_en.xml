  <objective>The EU urban transport system is not sustainable, by 2050, meaning that the urban mobility systems will have consumed approximately 17.3% of the Earth’s total biocapacity.
URBAN TRANSPORT NEED: We need to optimise the efficiency and effectiveness of urban traffic management, but without sacrificing our limit our freedom of movement.
PROBLEM SOURCE: In Europe, exist more than one million taxis which represents 10-20% of urban traffic in major cities. In average, taxis drive more than 80,000 kilometers per year mostly in inner-city areas. Despite its significance, taxi transport it’s a highly inefficient system, in fact 50% of time a taxi its empty looking for customers or a booking service demand.
Taxi industry urgently needs to implement STM systems to transform it into an efficient and sustainable transport according to current smart cities.
OUR SOLUTION SMARTAXI: Smartaxi innovative solution is an intelligent software to make accurate and reliable prediction of time-localization customer demand. Our aim is to provide a solution to urban city congestion through the optimization of taxi management. For the first time, we will be able to anticipate customer demand (5 min-24h forecasting) with 95 % of accuracy. Smartaxi provide reliable forecast of customer demand, which suppose 32% savings in taxi operational costs and 3,5 M Tons of CO2 in Europe. The platform will disrupt the urban taxi market by introducing an innovative forecasting customer demand system 100% adaptable to any urban context. 
Technical feasibility study: to finalized the technical validation of the system by: (1) improving the statistic models for future improvements in the predictive system, improvement on scalability and (2) user design making a friendlier intuitive application. To develop a business plan for our international expansion.
