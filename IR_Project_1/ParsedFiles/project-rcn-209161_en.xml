  <objective>Based on an ongoing ERC project on characterising and studying the motility of highly-idealised, model micro-swimmers, we have built and validated a first-generation portable prototype device for assaying accurately bull sperm motility. To move to a more advanced prototype requires integrated software and hardware development and the setting up of standard protocols to render the measurement procedure robust for non-expert operators. Such a device, with integrated hardware and software, for Portable Characterisation of Sperm Motility (PorCSperM) will assembled and applied to bull semen in this project, but is in principle applicable to other animals, and perhaps also to human fertility.</objective>
