  <objective>Recent space-based geodetic measurements of ground deformation suggest a paradigm shift is required in our understanding of the behaviour of active tectonic faults. The classic view of faults classified in two groups – the locked faults prone to generate earthquakes and the creeping faults releasing stress through continuous aseismic slip – is now obscured by more and more studies shedding light on a wide variety of seismic and aseismic slip events of variable duration and size. What physical mechanism controls whether a tectonic fault will generate a dynamic, catastrophic rupture or gently release energy aseismically? Answering such a fundamental question requires a tool for systematic and global detection of all modes of slip along active faults.
The launch of the Sentinel 1 constellation is a game changer as it provides, from now on, systematic Radar mapping of all actively deforming regions in the world with a 6-day return period. Such wealth of data represents an opportunity as well as a challenge we need to meet today. In order to expand the detection and characterization of all slip events to a global scale, I will develop a tool based on machine learning procedures merging the detection capabilities of all data types, including Sentinel 1 data, to build time series of ground motion.
The first step is the development of a geodetic data assimilation method with forecasting ability toward the first re-analysis of active fault motion and tectonic phenomena. The second step is a validation of the method on three faults, including the well-instrumented San Andreas (USA) and Longitudinal Valley faults (Taiwan) and the North Anatolian Fault (NAF, Turkey). I will deploy a specifically designed GPS network along the NAF to compare with outputs of our method. The third step is the intensive use of the algorithm on a global scale to detect slip events of all temporal and spatial scales for a better understanding of the slip behaviour along all active continental faults.</objective>
