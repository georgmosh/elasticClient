  <objective>MYR&lt;i&gt;CE aims at contributing to the study of the cultural history of Byzantium and the dissemination of its memory across the centuries, by considering a major monument – the church of the Holy Apostles at Constantinople – and the symbolism associated to it. The objective of the research is to understand the reason why this monument occupies a crucial place in Byzantine and Mediaeval times. To seize the specific status of this monument, I will run an investigation into a set of sources referring to it (textual, iconographic) and follow the paths of its dissemination across time and space. My twofold training in philology and art history will be essential for the analysis of the material relevant to the case and for the successful accomplishment of MYR&lt;i&gt;CE. For the first time, the enforced analysis will treat the monument as a historical element, inserted in the process of cultural transmission, thus giving a significant contribution to shifting traditional scholarly focus away from the mere consideration of its architectural forms. The methodology adopted will promote cultural historical modes of investigation, opening new avenues of research for the field. Given the importance of the example chosen, this project is potentially entitled to become a reference model for other comparable case-studies. MYR&lt;i&gt;CE comes appropriately timed, in a moment in which the monument is drawing again scholarly attention. The mobility plan proposed will allow training at EPHE to acquire the methods of questioning textual and visual material from an historical and anthropological perspective, in order to understand the topic proposed in its cultural specificity, and residence at UNIVE in order to develop the hermeneutical part of the study and to access textual and monumental sources (San Marco) relevant to the case. The action will let me benefit from interaction with an international network of excellence, in compliance with the goals set within the ERA framework.</objective>
