  <objective>In average Europeans consume 650kg of bread per person per year. To answer the increasing demand in term of variety and quality, both industrial and craft bakers need to improve qualitative, economic and energetic process efficiency. The current baking plates in the ovens are made from concrete  and are energetic inefficient, having a low life expectancy and reduce the quality of the products.  Conrad Liphard &amp; Söhne has developed a new and innovative baking plate from ceramic with outstanding baking characteristics, Thermoback. This development has demonstrated energy-efficient, durable, and heat conduction improvement. The plate is made of a mixture of calcium oxide, aluminum oxide, as well as various additives as silicon carbide which helps to reach optimal heating values. Thermoback demonstrated: about 30% of energy savings, high stability of the plates (firm, unbreakable plates), time savings up to 25%, and a higher product quality.  Liphard &amp; Söhne wants to introduce thermoback technology into the market, and  therefore, with the requested fund, a feasibility study as well as a market research will facilitate the product’s entry.</objective>
