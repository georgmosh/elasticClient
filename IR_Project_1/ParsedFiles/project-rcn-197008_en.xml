  <objective>Todayâ€™s current food system is unsustainable economically, environmentally and socially. Given finite arable land, fuel and water supplies, innovative self-sufficient farming modules are a solution to contribute to mitigate this global challenge.
Pnat s.r.l., a dynamic SME, spin-off of the University of Florence, established to emphasize a culture of innovation and technological excellence, is developing Jellyfish Barge, a floating agricultural greenhouse, able to purify salt, brackish or polluted water using solar energy. Jellyfish Barge is built with low-cost technologies and simple materials, also appropriate to the self-construction paradigm. A feasibility study and a business plan will be crucial for the assessment of the strength of our business, giving us the key features to address the future development of our activities and market entry. According to our proposal, in 6 months, we will dedicate great attention to the analysis of the market, the business strategy, the economic viability and special effort will be invested in exploiting eco-sustainable solutions for the reduction of the productive costs. Furthermore, a geographic viability assessment, and the development of a parametric table that integrates all information achieved, will be useful tools to model our business potentiality and viability.</objective>
