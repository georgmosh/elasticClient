  <objective>CyanoAlert will be a global service for the environmental authorities and commercial sector, concerned by health risks and quality of water resources. The proposed project will deliver a fully automated application for assessing toxin producing cyanobacteria blooms in water resources globally, using ground-breaking Copernicus Earth Observation technology. The service foresees a dual dissemination system that provides user-specific information for monitoring and reporting purposes to customers, and a free and open information service for the public based on mobile telecommunication. South African and European SMEs will partner with users in the environmental authority and commercial sector, in order to establish a sustainable supply chain, based on a sound business model, to bring this innovative service to market.</objective>
