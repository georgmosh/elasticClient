  <objective>Daylighting reduces the need for electric light by introducing natural light into a building and improves indoor environmental quality. Numerous daylight transport systems have been developed to improve natural illumination in the deep core of buildings by means of piping light from the building envelope to be distributed in the interior space. However, the current solutions can’t bring the daylight into buildings deeper than 20 m from façade or roof, and thus are not suitable for deep-plan and high-rise buildings.

The ECHYNOXE SILICA project objective is to develop a new concept of daylighting based on highly light-transmitting fibre optics coupled with Fresnel lenses.

This disruptive innovation will have the opportunity to introduce sufficient ambient light levels up to 150 m from façade or roof and consequently has the potential to widen the market of daylighting systems to all types of buildings.

The project is leaded by an innovative French SME, ECHY which develops daylighting devices based on fibre optics technology for natural lighting, to improve the quality of diffused light and to reduce electricity consumption. The strategy of the company is the improvement of the technology via R&amp;D efforts while commercializing and making the first references of the technology.

ECHY will conduct a feasibility study (phase 1) to prove the technical compatibility with the high-rise and deep-plan buildings constraints. The phase 1 will result in the elaboration of a business plan.

The ECHY project answers to current directions towards greener buildings implying sustainable design and healthy
environments for people.</objective>
