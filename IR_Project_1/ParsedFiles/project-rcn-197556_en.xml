  <objective>The SOLENCO POWER BOX TM (SPB) eliminates the uncertainty in supply and cost of energy for family homes and commercial buildings by using small-scale energy storage based on hydrogen technology, in combination with renewable energy sources (wind and solar PV). The SPBTM is a Decentralized Power Production &amp; Storage Device and enables a shift in the energy model from central distribution to local generation and distribution while stabilizing the grid and hence enabling higher penetration (up to 100%) solar PV energy. The product enables EU households to be 100% independent from the grid and 100% independent from price fluctuations in fossil fuels. It is the missing link for mass uptake of residential PV solar and your insurance against rising energy prices.

The goal of Phase 1 of the SME instrument is to define, prioritize, and validate the application, value proposition and target market(s) for the product to draft an elaborated Business and Financial Plan. The objective is to use this Business and Financial Plan to convince potential investors to invest additional equity capital in the SPBTM to fund the mass-production and mass-commercialization of the product.</objective>
