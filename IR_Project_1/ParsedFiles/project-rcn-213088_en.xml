  <objective>"
Based upon the finding from IMAILE PCP of Innovative STEM/PLE (www.imaile.eu), the project LEARNTECH ACCELERATOR ( LEA)  will take a quantum leap from being one standalone project to  critical mass of European procurers  who will:

1. Unify LEA procurers network and ""Observer Cities ""
2. Implement  IMAILE PCP lessons learned as LEA baseline 
3. Recommend a LEARNTECH Demand policy - 2030 to reduce fragmentation of  the  public sector 
4. Enable increased dialogue between demand/ supply side 
5. Provide transfer of knowledge for the LEARNTECH community ( other procurers, industry, start-ups , end - users and policy level) in order to remove barriers of innovative procurement 
6. Prepare one PPI ( based upon IMAILE) and one additional future PCP 
7. Speed up awareness rising  of innovative procurement including cross sectorial value chains 

LEA WP- METHODOLOGY  is developed in order to achieve the above mentioned objectives and with focus to  ""ACCELERATE"": 

- LEA network collaboration ( WP 2) 
- Demand  policy recommendations ( WP 3)  
- Dialogue tools/ venues between demand &amp; supply side  ( WP 4) 
- Knowledge transfer within the community ( WP5) 
- Awareness rising on EU level ( WP 6) 
 

This unified and knowledge based  action will result in the  LEA ROADMAP  2030 including: 

-Critical mass of European procurers of LEARNTECH in collaboration acting first customers 
-User cases for evidence of cost&amp; time saving/ standardization/ interoperability as results of innovative procurement 
-2030 LEARNTECH market foresight and demand policy 
-Training material/methods/tools for increased competence and dynamic dialogue among LEARNTECH community  
-One prepared PPI absed upon IMAILE with lessons learned 
- One addtional prepared PCP identified in LEA 

Implementation of the LEA project  shall contribute to SMART, INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE DEMAND BASED DEVELOPMENT OF LEARNING TECHNOLOGY
