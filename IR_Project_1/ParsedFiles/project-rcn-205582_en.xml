  <objective>INNOVIP Consortium will reinvent the top-of-the-line insulating material vacuum-insulation-panels (VIP)  by improving their thermal performance over the entire lifetime by at least 25 % and making VIPs adjustable, mountable and machineable. By reducing the density of the core material and/or using an alternative core material together with less expensive VIP-envelopes as gas barrier, it will be possible to sell the new product INNOVIP by more than 20 % lower price. Besides, the new product has a reduced embodied energy by at least 25 % and, attaching different cover layers, the panels can fulfill different functions. These additional functions can be adjusted according to the application they address, for example photocatalytic VOC removal from indoor- and outdoor air, anti mould coating, moisture buffering by Aluminium Compounds or summer heat cut-off by latent heat activated in phase change materials (PCMs). 

Currently there is no such material on the market. INNOVIP will develop such an innovative solution which will lead to a breakthrough in energy efficiency of the opaque parts of the building envelope â€“ both in new built and existing houses. The success of the development process will be demonstrated in two prototypes that can be tested and validated. Development tasks will be carried out in close cooperation with the three complementary and reputed participating testing laboratories. We will show that, in principle, the new product is ready for use in certain important and representative applications, addressing a relevant market volume by replacing conventional insulating materials and standard VIP in established insulation solutions.</objective>
