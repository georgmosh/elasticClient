  <objective>The efficient generation of Quantum states of light is a vital task in Quantum Photonics technologies. Current approaches are generally bulky and expensive with low generation rates. The state of art solutions do not scale.
In this project, the Fellow l will develop a new integrated photonic platform based on the Lithium Niobate on Insulator platform, which will provide compact and highly efficient sources of the , heralded single photons and entangled photon pairs at the telecommunication that are now vital to the secure transmission of information.
The Fellow will be able to use the training provided by the project to restart her career after a break to rear children. Her skills in nanofabrication will be refreshed and brought up to date. She will learn  skills in the discipline of Quantum photonics, which is new to her, including the design design and simulation and the characterisation of the generated quantum states of light. In the final stages of the project, the devices will be validated in an industrial environment and the Fellow will be trained in the requirements of industrial qualification.</objective>
