  <objective>Solutions to facilitate international transport and trade are growing in parallel with global BNP growth. The recent digitalization of customs is creating opportunities in this market. ClearView Trade’s cloud based collaborative solution and business model is positioned to disrupt and exploit the opportunities in the SME market and dedicated to open standards. Importers and exporters rely on manual or semi-manual processes to facilitate cross-border transactions, such processes are both inefficient and error-prone, and as a result, 40-50% of all customs declarations are incorrect. We are the first company to introduce a collaborative platform that supports the process from export to import end-to-end. Export and import declarations are based on the same data, and by enabling exporters and importers to share and re-use these data in a mutual system, we create substantial savings, especially for the SME segment. Based on our current experience, we reduce the exporters’ time consumption by 50-80%, this amount to € 2,5 to 10 pr. Shipment.
