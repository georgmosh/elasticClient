  <objective>This proposal presents a research program aimed at breaking new ground in theoretical, algorithmic and practical aspects of the notoriously difficult matching problems. The main goal is developing a unified algorithmic framework for matching problems that enjoys theoretical guarantees and high practical value for "real-life" applications.

The core methodological aspect is the modelling of matching problems as high-dimensional, lifted convex problems that can be efficiently approximated. We present several case-studies of this methodology, constructing efficient algorithms for approximating the solutions of important instances of the matching problem. The results already demonstrate state of the art performance and are backed-up with novel theoretical analysis proving tightness and correctness of the suggested convexifications for certain classes of non-trivial input.

This proposal has "high risk - high impact" profile: The "high-risk" aspect of this proposal comes from the hardness of general matching problems which, when faithfully represented, are NP-hard. However, as we demonstrate, combining convex optimization tools in a careful way, that takes into account computational complexity, is likely to push forward the limits of current algorithmic solutions. The "High-impact" will be immediate: As matching problems exist in almost every aspect of scientific research, practical generic algorithms for matching problems are likely to have a significant influence.

We believe that the inroads and preliminary results presented in this proposal already provide strong evidence for the potential success of the suggested research program.</objective>
