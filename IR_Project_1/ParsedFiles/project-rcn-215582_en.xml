  <objective>The ultimate goal of my research is to elucidate pathways involved in lung neuroendocrine tumor (LNET) formation. LNETs arise from a rare lung cell population, called pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) and account for 20- to 25% of all lung cancers. Despite their involvement in LNETs and a number of other respiratory diseases, relatively little is known about the normal function of PNECs or their contribution to cancer development and progression. Utilizing a novel organoid based strategy for in vitro isolation and analysis of PNECs, I will develop a model of LNE tumorigenesis with a focus on two LNET subtypes, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and atypical carcinoids (AC). Altogether, the experiments outlined in this proposal are focused on the functional characterization of PNECs and the elucidation of the pathways involved in the transformation of this cell type during LNET formation.</objective>
