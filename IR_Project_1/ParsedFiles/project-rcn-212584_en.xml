  <objective>The overarching aim of IBISBA 1.0 is to support and accelerate the uptake of industrial biotechnology as a key enabling technology for advanced manufacturing. To do this, IBISBA 1.0 will provide a distributed network of research infrastructure facilities to promote R&amp;D in bioprocess development and support this bioeconomy KET. The facilities cover a variety of experimental and in silico operations and disciplines, and together represent the R&amp;D continuum in the range TRL2 to 6 needed to build quality biomanufacturing processes for industrialization. In addition to hardware, IBISBA 1.0 will operate an ICT platform, linking all project events occurring on facilities, and external data repositories, and provide users with end-to-end project management and access to a wide variety of research assets. Together, these developments create the basis for a future pan-European research infrastructure for industrial biotechnology, the feasibility of which will be established during the project. Through IBISBA 1.0, the participant facilities will be opened for transnational access, thus providing cutting edge technologies to a cross section of Europeâ€™s researchers, including early career stage scientists. Users and facility operators will receive remote and on-site training, and immersion in the hallmark multidisciplinary environment of IBISBA 1.0. Transnational access will be facilitated by an ambition outreach plan that will provide users, including SMEs and other industry players, with complete information about service offers, but also insight into the potentiality of IPR held by IBISBA 1.0 partners and the opportunities for innovation. Interoperability will be a focus of considerable attention, with actions directed towards harmonization and the implementation of repeatable working practices that integrate experimentation with data analysis, and data management, thus providing the basis for the sharing and reuse of data assets in a framework of Open Science.</objective>
