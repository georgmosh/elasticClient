  <objective>Rapid and sensitive analyte determination in small volumes is one of the main tasks in modern diagnostics for the development of miniaturized in vitro test systems. This is critically important for both health and environmental diagnostics. The traditional approach (ELISA) is a time-consuming multistep process with sensitivity limitations due to usually used planar supports for detection. In this project we intend to develop a new approach for biosensing based on porous antibody microparticles. For this purpose, the combination of a new technique to assemble porous particles at mild conditions (host know-how) and highly sensitive ELISA-based detection system (applicant know-how) will be used. The porous particles will work as a platform with two crucial features: i) specific immunochemical reactions are realized on highly developed particle surface, ii) separation and detection in small volumes (micrometer dimensions). We believe that the proposed approach may open new avenues in future for effective diagnostics.</objective>
