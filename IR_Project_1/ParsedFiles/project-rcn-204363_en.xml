  <objective>The aim of GEOFOOD project is to develop an innovative eco-friendly industrial process to enable the use of geopolymers (produced from metakaolin) and 3D printing technology in the production of food preparation/storage ceramic objects (e.g.vessels for wine, beer, etc. production/storage). Geopolymers have the advantages of delivering food safety to consumers (no use of toxic pigments) and reducing energy consumption. 3D printing brings the additional values of faster manufacturing, full individualization and waste reduction. The business opportunity is tangible: Cibas has already been receiving requests from at least 10 companies from EU and USA, specifically wine and beer producers. These sectors are the initial most relevant market segments, because of their needs for innovative vessels with advantages in terms of biocompatibility, food safety, recyclability. Additional market segments include vinegar and extra-virgin olive oil production.The market potential is significant considering: the growth (+15% in 2009-2016) in tableware, cookingware and items for industrial use. Food/drink industry is the largest manufacturing industry in the EU (turnover of â‚¬ 956 billion in 2010). This project wants to verify: the technological feasibility (use of industrial grade of food safe metakaolin; validation of geopolymer best formulae for 3D printing); the economic viability (market penetration rate assessment, end users involvement, IP management, innovation strategy). Coherently, in Phase 2, Cibas will carry on activities such as: deployment and validation of an industrial plant; production and testing of scaled-up prototypes; validation of prototypes via panels/focus groups; market exploitation. The project contributes to face some of the main European challenges: a) expected CO2 reduction per year in Europe of 170.625 Tons/CO2; b) reduction of toxic waste (-25.000 Tons) thanks to 3D printing manufacturing; c) more competitive and faster industry (-25%time/piece).</objective>
