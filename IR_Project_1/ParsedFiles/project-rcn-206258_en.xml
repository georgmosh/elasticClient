  <objective>The Transformations to Sustainability (T2S) ERA-NET Cofund programme will be implemented in the context of a Belmont Forum Collaborative Research Action in cooperation with the NORFACE (New Opportunities for Research Funding Agency Cooperation in Europe) network and the International Social Science Council (ISSC). A comprehensive and concerted research initiative is needed that can boost research on transformations to sustainability, that can catalyse new kinds of solutions to environmental and social challenges. This T2S programme therefore seeks to bring into being and nurture integrated teams of scientists from relevant academic disciplines including, as appropriate, social, natural, human, natural, engineering, agricultural and health/medical sciences disciplines and societal stakeholders to produce new knowledge and perspectives that can contribute to finding equitable and durable solutions to the challenges of sustainability in specific contexts, in support of the Sustainable Development Goals. This programme will contribute to re-structuring the broad field of sustainability research to place social science at the heart of interdisciplinary efforts and will contribute to a step change in scale and scope for research programming on this topic. 

This future-oriented call will be jointly undertaken by major funding agencies in Europa, the United States, Brazil, Taiwan and Japan. The T2S programme will coordinate the research efforts of the participating Member States and international partners by implementing a joint trans-national call with European Commission co-funding to fund innovative comparative, transnational and interdisciplinary research initiatives within this thematic field. The T2S partners will pursue the expansion of their present effective collaboration and actively strive at widening the consortium.</objective>
