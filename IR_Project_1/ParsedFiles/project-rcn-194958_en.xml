  <objective>The Ocean Data Interoperability Platform project is promoting the development of a common global framework for marine data management by developing interoperability between existing regional e-infrastructures. Through a series of international workshops attracting relevant domain experts a number of prototype interoperability solutions will be developed which will be implemented by the regional data infrastructures to provide users with open access to good quality multidisciplinary data and associated services. Improved access to a range of marine data will facilitate re-use of the data and support researchers in addressing grand challenges such as climate change and conservation of marine resources.</objective>
