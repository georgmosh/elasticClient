  <objective>The MANU-SQUARE project creates a European platform-enabled responsible ecosystem acting as a virtual marketplace, bringing available manufacturing capacity closer to production demand to achieve their optimal matching thus fostering, on the one hand, fast and efficient creation of local and distributed value networks for innovative providers of product-services and, on the other hand, reintroduction and optimization in the loop of unused capacity that would be wasted otherwise.
In a wider perspective the MANU-SQUARE project pursues a paradigm shift that disrupts the traditional static supply chain model and establishes dynamic value networks that can be arranged on-demand to couple the needs of buyers and the availability of sellers of manufacturing capacity. In so doing, this latter becomes an easily and efficiently tradable commodity towards lowered production costs for European companies and improved manufacturing ecosystem actual productivity.</objective>
