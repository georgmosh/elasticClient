  <acronym>MICCS-SQ</acronym>
  <objective>The consortium (formed by 3 SMEs: Biorem, DGE and SSD) aims to deliver into market a technology for on-site and realtime
site investigation through high-performance probes, comprising sonic drilling combined with patented geo-radar
technology (GPR), chemometry data analysis and 3D model presentation.
This new approach for soil and subsoil investigation and characterization will disrupt with current approaches, which are
based on an off-site process, involving vertical drilling and collecting soil samples for chemical analysis in laboratories (with a
number of limitations related to cost-efficiency, time between sampling and results, and reliability of the sampling process
and analysis).
The novel MICCS solution will bring analytical capacity to the market where the new equipment is able to map the zone, plan
optimal sampling strategy, collect data while drilling, and report data through tridimensional distribution of contaminants â€“
eliminating the need of off-site laboratory analysis, which often result lead to lower quality of the samples (caused by
evaporation of contaminants). The consortium wishes to achieved through this multi-component tool comprising drilling,
chemometric analysis and 'Intelligent' data treatment, an improvement of the overall quality on soil contaminant analysis
which can be completed (from sampling to analytical processed results) in-situ during one single visit to the target zone. The
adoption of the MICCS technology will result in a faster (30%), cheaper (20%) and more accurate and reliable soil
characterization process. The MICCS technology is also aligned with the EU priority focused on raw materials used in
industry, which represents a very significant part of the sources causing soil contamination. MICCS will allow a fast,
complete and reliable evaluation of the soil contamination impact of these raw material supply industries and subsequent soil
remediation allowing an efficient and sustainable land resource management.</objective>
