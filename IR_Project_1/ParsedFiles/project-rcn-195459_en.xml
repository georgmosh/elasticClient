  <objective>The research proposed here is principally aimed at computing the full quantum entropy of black holes in string theory, especially in scenarios with reduced supersymmetry, by using localisation to evaluate supersymmetric path integrals. As an additional feature, we shall also explicate how more refined information about quantum black holes, rather than just the total number of microstates, may be extracted by these means. We shall further explicate the recently noticed appearance of mock modular forms in computations of black hole entropy in string theory.</objective>
