  <objective>BIODEST (Synthesis, Characterization, Structure and Properties of Novel Biodegradable Polyesters) Research and Innovation Staff Exchange (RISE) project aims to strengthen around student and staff exchanges with the aim to improve skills and knowledge of the participating partners and promote collaboration between four European Research organizations: University of the Basque Country (Spain), University of Mons (Belgium), University of Genova (Italy), and University of Warwick (U.K.) and five non-EU Research Organizations: University of Tulane (USA), Chinese Academy of Science (China), Simon Bolivar University (Venezuela), University of Stellenbosch (South Africa), and Yamagata University (Japan). Moreover the non-academic European organization “Ma+D - Waste Valorization Engineering” will collaborate in the networking activities. The project will provide support for the participating research organizations to establish or reinforce long-term research cooperation in the topic of novel biodegradable polyesters through a coordinated joint programme of exchange of researchers for short periods.</objective>
