  <acronym>New Gluten World</acronym>
  <objective>Led by inventor Carmen Lamacchia, New Gluten World (NGW) is a company that aims at bringing on the market its revolutionary proprietary technology that will be used in milling processes to detoxify gluten in wheat. The traditional approach to celiac disease – that is, a “gluten free” diet or detoxified gluten with expensive enzymes – will be replaced by a new, disruptive and cost-effective approach, where a natural and safe physic-chemical process modifies the toxic component of gluten, while leaving its mechanical, nutritional, and sensorial properties. Celiac, intolerant, and glutensensitive patients will have the chance of a new lifestyle, without suffering the “nutritional divide” with respect to healthy individuals. The methodology stems from the advanced biotech research conducted at the University of Foggia and addresses a grand social and economic challenge for Europe and for the world, where celiac patients are on average 1% of the world population, while 30% has gluten-sensitivity, with figures increasing every year.
Thanks to a strong team, with industrial and technological expertise, NGW will enable milling companies (mostly SMEs) in Europe and abroad to adopt the process technology and related know-how, thus reinforcing the well-known leadership of the European agro-food industry in terms of quality, as opposed to intensive productions by other economic systems. The market opportunity is huge, fenced by a patent extended in 104 countries. Such opportunity will be seized by NGW moving from TRL #6 to TRL #8 and #9 in a 24-month time-span. Aiming to become the market leader for industrial processes in detoxifying gluten in cereals for all markets (backed products, pasta, ice-creams, beer), NGW plans to reach a turnover of over 100M€ by 2022, with an ambitious hiring plan of qualified workers in Europe. NGW received the prestigious NutriAward (2015) and a manifestation of interest from a leading European venture capital firm that will support its growth.</objective>
