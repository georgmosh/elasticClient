  <objective>Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a frequent neurological disorder in childhood (2 per 1,000 births). The EU has 1.3m of the 15m persons with CP globally. Participation in daily activities with other individuals and inclusion in cooperative learning paths by playing digital games can promote health &amp; well-being with such disabilities as is identified in Europe 2020. GABLE is a highly innovative online service platform to personalise games to enhance the living adjustment of people with CP avoiding a gamification process where one fits for all. GABLE will be an open platform combining (i) the results of phase from the very successful FP7-SME-2012 “Research for SMEs” project (GA 315032) that ended in Nov 2014, (ii) the results of RAGE project and (iii) the technologies derived from machine learning under a multiplayer approach combining fixed and mobile devices. It enables carers &amp; clinical staff to easily create (using visual programming &amp; no special IT skills) interactive games customised to individual’s abilities using unique computer vision &amp; image processing techniques. Caregivers will adapt content and difficulty levels of the games according to the interests, abilities and progress of each individual user.
Moving from the currently TRL6 to TRL8, five of the original partners in the Research phase will adapt the GameAbling platform to the new scenario and will develop a testing period piloting trials to operate/validate the system productisation at 8 diverse reference care centres over 18 months. The project will produce a total of 30 personalised games (5 per pilot). 
The strategy of the consortium is to take advantage from the good results on the remedial use of games for children with CP in order to develop new business scenarios based on the success in that niche, where further inclusion &amp; learning gaming markets will be addressed. The project will develop/validate a Business Plan to commercially deploy the service on a mainly subscription basis.</objective>
