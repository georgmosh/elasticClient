  <objective>ERCcOMICS is a creative and ambitious project which proposes to exploit the power of visual storytelling through webcomics to promote and explain the achievements of ERC funded projects and the benefits of the ERC funding scheme for technological and scientific development, as well as for society as a whole. ERComics will:
- produce 16 webcomics about carefully selected ERC funded, drawn by different comic artists;
- organise graphic facilitated TED-style lectures jointly held by ERC grantees and comic artists;
- organise at least two exhibitions about the project itself;
- carry out all needed actions of dissemination to maximise the impact of the project.</objective>
