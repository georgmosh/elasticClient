  <objective>Development of novel probiotic solutions for specific illnesses and health problems, ex: Obesity, Depression, Crohn or Colitis diseases.

The solutions proposed by MyBiotics will use Mycrobe TM a delivery technology to overpass the biologic barriers :gastric acid, pancreatic juice and bile salts, and deliver sufficient quantity of living probiotic directly to colonize the gastro intestinal tract were they are therapeutically efficient.

MyBiotics will design for each targeted disease a set of specific bacteria and validate their selection by using MycrobeTM as leverage to provide unreached comfort and easy variation during the selection and test of the probiotics.

The ambition is to provide pharmabiotic solutions for specific diseases and provide robust clinical results for lobbying activities with the EMA, EFSA and FDA for the regulation</objective>
