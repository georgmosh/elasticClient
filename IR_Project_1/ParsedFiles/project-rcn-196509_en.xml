  <objective>With project EcoVel, COIN Consulting UG will realize the first laundry product generating an almost completely closed resource cycle of non-actives (monomolecular fiber, concentrated liquid in combination with solid particles for superior cleaning). The fabric, which even allows for color and fluff catching, is 100% recyclable, does not include any filling additives and has the potential (by further development) to outperform all other laundry products concerning cleaning power. Estimates based on the sustainability report from Henkel 2013 suggest a reduction of the CO2 emissions of nearly 70% by the use of the laundry wipe in comparison to regular powder detergents. The main reason for this reduction is attributable to low weight in transportation and energy efficient production without a counter stream and heating process. This eco-innovation will also have a global effect with respect to climatic issues and green economy.
To market the laundry wipe it is necessary to conduct a feasibility study which includes benchmark cleaning power tests, consumer product tests, IP research and a series of production tests. The results of the feasibility study will allow us to prepare a validated business plan which is necessary for assessing finance and marketing the product through major European retailers.</objective>
